6 Quick tips that apply to all Linux desktops:
Disable every service that isn’t required
Close every port except one’s required to be in use.
Disable remote root login.
Do not run anything as root unless you must.
Change the default SSH port to a high non-standard port.
Keep your software and system up to date through its respective maintainers’ repositories.
	

General
Due to the large amount of variation in the Linux environment, a one-size fits all approach doesn’t really work. Because of this, I have listed some best practices and tools one can use to help in hardening their systems.

Tools

Artillery.py
https://github.com/trustedsec/artillery
Artillery is a combination of a honeypot, monitoring tool, and alerting system. Eventually this will evolve into a hardening monitoring platform as well to detect insecure configurations from nix systems. It's relatively simple, run ./setup.py and hit yes, this will install Artillery in /var/artillery and edit your /etc/init.d/rc.local to start artillery on boot up.
Why artillery?	
It sets up multiple common ports that are attacked. If someone connects to these ports, it blacklists them forever (to remove blacklisted ip's, remove them from /var/artillery/banlist.txt)
It monitors what folders you specify, by default it checks /var/www and /etc for modifications.
It monitors the SSH logs and looks for brute force attempts.
It will email you when attacks occur and let you know what the attack was.

Bastille Linux

Summary(From their “What is…”)
The Bastille Hardening program "locks down" an operating system, proactively configuring the system for increased security and decreasing its susceptibility to compromise. Bastille can also assess a system's current state of hardening, granularly reporting on each of the security settings with which it works. 

Bastille currently supports the Red Hat (Fedora Core, Enterprise, and Numbered/Classic), SUSE, Debian, Gentoo, and Mandrake distributions, along with HP-UX. It also supports Mac OS X. 

Bastille's focuses on letting the system's user/administrator choose exactly how to harden the operating system. In its default hardening mode, it interactively asks the user questions, explains the topics of those questions, and builds a policy based on the user's answers. It then applies the policy to the system. In its assessment mode, it builds a report intended to teach the user about available security settings as well as inform the user as to which settings have been tightened.
Lynis

From the above: Lynis is an open source security auditing tool. Its main goal is to audit and harden Unix and Linux based systems. It scans the system by performing many security control checks.

I would look at the documentation for more info on what it actually does.

Web Browser
Firefox
If you really need to be told what Firefox is, I don’t even. Iceweasel is firefox for intents and purposes relating to plugins.

Firefox Plugins
One of the beautiful things Firefox are the plugins, and the extra functionality added through them. The list below is my recommendations for securing your browser as well as controlling what information it sends out.
Adblock - Blocks ads. Ads are a large vector of attack due to the lack of verification within the advertising industry.

Noscript - Allows for granular control of Javascript on pages.

Request Policy - Control the HTTP requests made by your browser to 3rd party websites.

Self destructing cookies - Prevent tracking and abuse of session information.

HTTPS Everywhere - Forces sites when possible to use HTTPS encryption.

Port Obfuscation

knockd
Description: knockd is a port-knock server. It listens to all traffic on an ethernet (or PPP) interface, looking for special "knock" sequences of port-hits. A client makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a port on the server. This port need not be open -- since knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic even if it's destined for a closed port. When the server detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command defined in its configuration file. This can be used to open up holes in a firewall for quick access.

Fwknop
Description: fwknop stands for the "FireWall KNock OPerator", and implements an authorization scheme called Single Packet Authorization (SPA). This method of authorization is based around a default-drop packet filter (fwknop supports iptables on Linux, ipfw on FreeBSD and Mac OS X, and PF on OpenBSD) and libpcap.
