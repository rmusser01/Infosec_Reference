	* [Real Software Engineering by Glenn Vanderburg(Lone Star Ruby Conference(2010)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP9AIUT9nos&feature=youtu.be)
		* Software engineering as it's taught in universities simply doesn't work. It doesn't produce software systems of high quality, and it doesn't produce them for low cost. Sometimes, even when practiced rigorously, it doesn't produce systems at all.  That's odd, because in every other field, the term "engineering" is reserved for methods that work.  What then, does real software engineering look like? How can we consistently deliver high-quality systems to our customers and employers in a timely fashion and for a reasonable cost? In this session, we'll discuss where software engineering went wrong, and build the case that disciplined Agile methods, far from being "anti-engineering" (as they are often described), actually represent the best of engineering principles applied to the task of software development.
	* [The Rise of the Meritocracy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy)
		* [...] a book by British sociologist and politician Michael Dunlop Young which was first published in 1958. It describes a dystopian society in a future United Kingdom in which intelligence and merit have become the central tenet of society, replacing previous divisions of social class and creating a society stratified between a merited power-holding elite and a disenfranchised underclass of the less merited. The essay satirised the Tripartite System of education that was being practised at the time.
	* [Operator: The Well-Rounded Hacker - Matthew Curtin(CircleCityCon2018)](https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/circlecitycon2018/circle-city-con-50-209-operator-the-well-rounded-hacker-matthew-curtin)
		* Technical skills are of little value if they cannot be put to work, which is to say, put in context. While specialization, and even hyperspecialization can provide certain advantages, it comes at a cost: the inability to adjust to changes outside of one's field of expertise. It is no secret that demand for "security professionals" is high, that barriers to entry are great, and that rate of burnout is high. What starts as specialization ends with pigeonholed: trapped in a position that is unrewarding. We introduce the `*Operator*`: a hacker with not only depth of knowledge, but important breadth, and the ability to apply the combination of skills to problems and opportunities encountered over a lifetime.

		* Capability Immaturity Model (CIMM) in software engineering is a parody acronym, a semi-serious effort to provide a contrast to the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The Capability Maturity Model is a five point scale of capability in an organization, ranging from random processes at level 1 to fully defined, managed and optimized processes at level 5. The ability of an organization to carry out its mission on time and within budget is claimed to improve as the CMM level increases.

		* In finance, the Sharpe ratio (also known as the Sharpe index, the Sharpe measure, and the reward-to-variability ratio) measures the performance of an investment (e.g., a security or portfolio) compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. It is defined as the difference between the returns of the investment and the risk-free return, divided by the standard deviation of the investment (i.e., its volatility). It represents the additional amount of return that an investor receives per unit of increase in risk.

		* [Cyber Career Pathways Tool - National Initiative For CyberSecurity Careers and Studies](https://niccs.us-cert.gov/workforce-development/cyber-career-pathways)
			* This tool presents a new and interactive way to explore work roles within the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. It depicts the Cyber Workforce according to five distinct, yet complementary, skill communities. It also highlights core attributes among each of the 52 work roles and offers actionable insights for employers, professionals, and those considering a career in Cyber.
		* [Q: Why Do Keynote Speakers Keep Suggesting That Improving Security Is Possible? A: Because Keynote Speakers Make Bad Life Decisions and Are Poor Role Models](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18/presentation/mickens)
			* Some people enter the technology industry to build newer, more exciting kinds of technology as quickly as possible. My keynote will savage these people and will burn important professional bridges, likely forcing me to join a monastery or another penance-focused organization. In my keynote, I will explain why the proliferation of ubiquitous technology is good in the same sense that ubiquitous Venus weather would be good, i.e., not good at all. Using case studies involving machine learning and other hastily-executed figments of Silicon Valley’s imagination, I will explain why computer security (and larger notions of ethical computing) are difficult to achieve if developers insist on literally not questioning anything that they do since even brief introspection would reduce the frequency of git commits. At some point, my microphone will be cut off, possibly by hotel management, but possibly by myself, because microphones are technology and we need to reclaim the stark purity that emerges from amplifying our voices using rams’ horns and sheets of papyrus rolled into cone shapes. I will explain why papyrus cones are not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, and then I will conclude by observing that my new start-up papyr.us is looking for talented full-stack developers who are comfortable executing computational tasks on an abacus or several nearby sticks.
		* [VB 2019 London Keynote address: The security products we deserve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHuQC1qLnJ4)
			* Everybody decries the state of the industry. Everyone hates the over-hyped headlines, the obvious FUD and the shameless snake-oil. So why do we have so much of it? This talk aims to examine several of the dark-patterns that have become perfectly acceptable in infosec and then aims to drill down to their root causes. With any luck, we will also get to discuss some options to chart our way out of this mess.

		* [Navigating Career Choices in InfoSec - Fernando Montenegro - BSides Detroit2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM2xCjrQSY4)
			* Making career choices can be intimidating and stressful. Perhaps this presentation can help. The tidal forces affecting technology impact our careers as well. If we're not actively managing them, we're leaving decisions to chance (or to others), and may not like the outcomes. This presentation describes a framework I've used over the past few years to evaluate both ongoing job satisfaction as well as new opportunities as they appear. I'm happy with the outcomes I've obtained with it, and have used this same framework when providing advice to others, and it has been well received. Hopefully it can help others as well.

			* In this presentation we'll will be going over introductions to the various focuses in information security and demoing the most common tools that are used in operational security, both offense and defense. You'll leave with an idea on how to freely obtain and use these tools so that you can have what you need for that first interview: experience and a passion for security. This is a green talk for people who don't have a clue on what offensive and defensive people do operationally, from a tool perspective.

			* Our field is full of extremely creative people who have a lot to offer the industry. But often we lose focus because we are working for a company that has their own goals and competing priorities. This leads to long hours of work, a declining quality of life, and various other troubles. In this talk I focus on the tidal wave of DOD-related opportunities that exist to fund novel research and cutting edge technology, all while allowing autonomy of the individual. I've personally used these sources to transition to running my own company and have helped a lot of folks in the industry do the same. I'll discuss why people should consider this as a career path, where to find these resources, and walk through exactly how to apply.

				* So, you think you want to be a penetration tester, or you already are and don't understand what the difference between you and all the other "so called" penetration testers out there. Think you know the difference between a Red Team, Penetration Test and a Vulnerability assessment? Know how to write a report your clients will actually read and understand? Can you leverage the strengths of your team mates to get through tough roadblocks, migrate, pivot, pwn and pillage? No? well this talk is probably for you then! We will go through the fascinating, intense and often crazily boring on-site assessment process. Talk about planning and performing Red Teams, how they are different, and why they can be super effective and have some fun along the way. I'll tell you stories that will melt your face, brain and everything in between. Give you the answers to all of your questions you never knew you had, and probably make you question your life choices. By the end of this session you will be ready to take your next steps into the job you've always wanted, or know deep inside that you should probably look for something else. There will be no judgment or shame, only information, laughter and fun.

			* As more people enter /r/elm and the Elm discourse, I have thought a lot about how "online communities" work. Patterns of conflict. Why those patterns exist. Structures that would diffuse that conflict in healthy ways. Initially I just wanted to get yelled at less, but I instead stumbled upon "a cultural history of open source" that may reveal a path to more civil and productive online communication in general. Attendees will leave with (1) an inside perspective on open source projects, (2) a historical and cultural framework that I think can improve online communities right now, and (3) some interesting references and ideas to explore further in their own projects and interactions.

		* Conflict can be a good thing, really. Without it, we get groupthink and dumbass decisions. But how we approach and resolve conflicts can make the difference between healthy conflict and an unproductive, frustrating fight. Why do we have so much of the latter? My graduate research on the conflict resolution style preferences of information security professionals sheds light on the “culture of no”: why infosec conflict so often results in fights, why we keep burning bridges to make a point, and why people can be unwilling to talk to us. More importantly, this research gives us ideas on how we can resolve conflicts without burning all the bridges" in other words, how we can begin to have nice things. (No hackers or statistics were harmed in this research.)

Examples are dedicated classroom teachers in an educational bureaucracy, many of the engineers and launch technicians and scientists at NASA, even some agricultural scientists and advisors in the former Soviet Union collective farming administration.`
			* `Secondly, there will be those dedicated to the organization itself. Examples are many of the administrators in the education system, many professors of education, many teachers union officials, much of the NASA headquarters staff, etc.`
		* The Iron Law states that in every case the second group will gain and keep control of the organization. It will write the rules, and control promotions within the organization.

The concept was enunciated in the 1969 book The Peter Principle by Peter and Raymond Hull.

It was started as my personal list of questions, which grew over time to include both things I'd like to see more of and red flags which I'd like to avoid. I've also noticed how few questions were asked by people I interviewed and I think those were missed opportunities.
		* 4 categories of questions: Connect, Culture, Challenges, Close
			1. How did you come to work here? 
			2. What do you love most about working here?
			3. Tell me about the most successful hire and why?
			4. Who didn't succeed as a new hire and why?
			5. Tell me about the company's biggest challenge this year and how will this job help to solve it?
			6. How will I measure my performance so I know I'm having a positive impact?
			7. If there were some skills or experience that you wish I had, what would they be?
			8. What are the next steps in the process?

It’s his own, highly irresponsible, sloppy test to rate the quality of software, and when anyone asks me what is wrong with their team I usually start by pointing the questioner at the test. Start here.  It’s a test with 12 points and as Joel says, “A score of 12 is perfect, 11 is tolerable, but a 10 or lower and you’ve got serious problems”. More important than the points, his test clearly documents what I consider to be healthy aspects of an engineering team, but there are other points to be made. So it is completely an homage to Joel that I offer The Rands Test.

			* The Information Security sector is a special place filled with special snowflakes. For a special snowflake, interviewing for a job can sometimes be a daunting or awkward task. There is a thin line when talking to humans between looking cocky and potato. On the other side, the interviewer must understand that there's a limited pool of special snowflakes. There's a sweet spot between auto-hiring someone and telling them you'll need three months to make a decision. Each snowflake must be nurtured into a beautiful snowerfly, or whatever their final form may be. For this talk I plan to start a conversation about how to interview and be interviewed in the information security space. Good interviews combine a mix of targeted questions, appropriate information sharing, and a goal of what you'd like to learn from a person and vice versa. Bad interviews... don't. This leads to bad hires, good snowflakes being pushed aside, stupid questions being asked, people being sad pandas, poor team cohesion, and a general overwhelming feeling of meh. Do not despair, this is a solvable situation. Come join me on the journey to being less meh at hiring!

		* [Playing Through Pain: The Impact of Secrets and Dark Knowledge - Richard Thieme(Defcon24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGrcHhfUZDk)
			* Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact when those secrets build a different map of reality than "normals" use and one has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. The cognitive dissonance that inevitably causes is managed by some with denial who live as if refusing to feel the pain makes it disappear. But as Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, refuses to go away. And when cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one's peril. But the constraints of one's work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one's clearances, work, and career. The real cost of security work and professional intelligence goes beyond dollars. It is measured in family life, relationships, and mental and physical well-being. The divorce rate is as high among intelligence professionals as it is among medical professionals, for good reason - how can relationships be based on openness and trust when one's primary commitments make truth-telling and disclosure impossible? Richard Thieme has been around that space for years. He has listened to people in pain because of the compelling necessities of their work, the consequences of their actions, the misfiring of imperfect plans, and the burdens of - for example - listening to terrorists slit someone's throat in real time, then having to act as if they had a normal day at the office. Thieme touched on some of this impact in his story, "Northward into the Night," published in the Ranfurly Review, Big City Lit, Wanderings and Bewildering Stories before collection in "Mind Games." The story illuminates the emotional toll of managing multiple personas and ultimately forgetting who you are in the first place. The bottom line is, trauma and secondary trauma have identifiable symptoms and they are everywhere in the "industry." The "hyper-real" space which the national security state creates by its very nature extends to normals, too, now, but it's more intense for professionals. Living as "social engineers," always trying to understand the other's POV so one can manipulate and exploit it, erodes the core self. The challenge is not abstract or philosophical, it's existential, fired into our faces every day at point blank range, and it constitutes an assault on authenticity and integrity. Sometimes sanity is at stake, too, and sometimes, life itself. In one week, two different people linked to the CIA told Thieme that going into that agency was like becoming a scientologist. Think about what that analogy means. For his own sake and sanity, Thieme has thought about it a lot and that's what this talk is about - the real facts of the matter and strategies for effective life-serving responses.
		* [The Road to Resilience How Real Hacking Redeems a Damnable Profession - Richard Thieme(Defcon26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHpFSIYlVoc)
			* Two years ago Richard Thieme spoke on “Playing Through the Pain: The Impact of Dark Knowledge on Security and Intelligence Professionals” for Def Con 24. He relied on dozens of experiences provided by colleagues over a quarter-century, colleagues from NSA, CIA, corporate, and military. Responses to the presentation have often been emotional and have corroborated his thesis. The real impact of this work on people over the long term has to be mitigated by counter-measures and strategies so scars can be endured or,even better,incorporated and put to use.  In this presentation, Thieme elaborates those strategies and counter-measures. In what is likely his final speech at Def Con, he speaks directly to the “human in the machine” AS a human being. It’s not about leaving the profession: it’s about what we can do to thrive and transcend the challenges. It‘s about “saving this space,” this play space of hacking, work and life, and knowing the cost of being fully human while encountering dehumanizing impacts.  It is easier to focus on exploits, cool tools, zero days, and the games we play in the space that “makes us smile.” It is not so easy to know how to play through the pain successfully. The damage to us does not show up in brain scans. It shows up in our families, our relationships, and our lives.  Thieme is not preaching, he is sharing insights based on what he too has had to transcend in his own life. They call a lot of us “supernormals,” which means we discovered resilient responses to deprivation, abuse, profound loss … or the daily challenges of work that makes clear that evil is real. We are driven, we never quit, we fight through adversity, we create and recreate personas that work, we do what has to be done. It pays to know how we do that and know THAT we know so we can recreate resilience in the face of whatever comes our way.   A contractor for NSA suggested that everyone inside the agency should see the video of “Playing Through the Pain.” A long-time Def Con attendee asks all new hires to watch “Staring into the Abyss,” a talk Thieme did a few years before. This subject matter is seldom discussed aloud “out here” and by all accounts is not taken seriously “inside,” which is perhaps why there have been half a dozen suicides lately at NSA and a CIA veteran said, “I have 23 suicides on my mind, the most recent senior people who could not live with what they knew.”  The assumption baked into this talk: real hacking, its ethos and its execution, provides the tools we need to do this damn thing right.

		* 'Try Harder', 'Lurk Moar', 'You're doing it wrong'. In the InfoSec community, we pride ourselves on being able to learn on our own and believe going through a 'trial by fire' is necessary in order to be a respected and established in the community. What we don't realize is, we have many opportunities to better guide each other and learn from one another in order to improve...but are we making the best use of those opportunities? In this talk, we will explore the benefits of mentoring based on research we gathered and using data collected from within our industry. We will also discuss what makes a good mentor/mentee and how to get the most out of the relationship to help one another-and the community-grow.

		* Worthwhile for the first comment in response to the article: "I don’t see anything “senior” about it, or even “engineer”.  Seeing problems and solving them is what everyone does.  Documenting the solution is one part of solving a problem.  An apprentice carpenter does these things, too, and so does a farmer, and a waiter.  Unfortunately, it’s not what most software companies reward, or how they operate.  Whenever I did this, my manager, at every software company I’ve worked for, would say:  “That’s cool, but you’re supposed to add the FooBar feature, and it needs to be done this Friday.  Don’t waste time with reverse-engineering, or documentation.  Just add one new field to the protocol somewhere.  We can clean it up Later(TM).”  This is Conway’s Law at work.  What sort of company encourages the creation of two critical components which are completely undocumented?  The sort of company which doesn’t reward documentation of critical components.  That’s not likely to change because the engineer that created them happened to leave.  (It took more time to reverse-engineer the protocol than it would have to document it when the knowledge was fresh.)  The PM and QA who allowed this to happen are still there, right?  What “Senior Engineer” really means is someone who’s spent enough time in the trenches to have earned a job title that allows them the latitude to make these sorts of improvements, and not have a PM question why they aren’t, instead, doing exactly what they were assigned.  Look back at the story.  Did the “senior engineer” go through proper channels to schedule a “reverse-engineer and document network protocol” task?  No, he clearly didn’t trust that it would happen.  Or maybe it was already there, but lowest priority (way below “fix CSS on IE”, of course).  What was his actual responsibility that week?  The story doesn’t say, but I don’t see any remarks about a PM breathing down his neck asking about the CSS fix he asked for (because that PM is the only user of the system, anywhere, of course, who uses IE and sees that particular bug).  Documentation is not on this week’s “Sprint”!  The process is fundamentally broken.  We hear fables like this about how life would be better if we all did something one way (you’ll get promoted to Senior Engineer!), while in practice we’re punished for doing so."

			* Attrition.org (http://attrition.org/) is a computer security web site dedicated to the collection, dissemination and distribution of information about the security industry for anyone interested in the subject. They maintain one of the only open and honest grim look at the industry, reminding everyone that we must strive to be better than we have been historically. The crusade to expose industry frauds and inform the public about incorrect information in computer security articles is a primary goal of the site. Previously, Attrition.org maintained the largest catalogs of security advisories, text files, and humorous image galleries. They are also known for maintaining the largest mirror of Web site defacements and the creation of the Data Loss Database (Open Source), which eventually became DatalossDB (http://datalossdb.org/).
