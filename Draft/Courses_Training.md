		* About this course: This course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. We’ll learn about the how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”) information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects. 
	* [ENISA CERT Exercises and Training](http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise)
		* ENISA CERT Exercises and training material was introduced in 2008, in 2012 and 2013 it was complemented with new exercise scenarios containing essential material for success in the CERT community and in the field of information security. In this page you will find the ENISA CERT Exercise material, containing Handbook for teachers, Toolset for students and Virtual Image to support hands on training sessions.
	* [SEEDLabs](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/all_labs.html)
		* People learn from mistakes. In security education, we study mistakes that lead to software vulnerabilities. Studying mistakes from the past not only help students understand why systems are vulnerable, why a "seemly-benign" mistake can turn into a disaster, and why many security mechanisms are needed. More importantly, it also helps students learn the common patterns of vulnerabilities, so they can avoid making similar mistakes in the future. Moreover, using vulnerabilities as case studies, students can learn the principles of secure design, secure programming, and security testing.

	* [Introductory Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration](http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html)
		* This class serves as a foundation for the follow on Intermediate level x86 class. It teaches the basic concepts and describes the hardware that assembly code deals with. It also goes over many of the most common assembly instructions. Although x86 has hundreds of special purpose instructions, students will be shown it is possible to read most programs by knowing only around 20-30 instructions and their variations.

I'd like to share my experience and show a roadmap to becoming a low-level programmer because I have found that these skills are not as common as they once were. In addition, many students and beginners ask me how they could become low-level programmers and Linux kernel engineers.

	* [The Life of Binaries](http://opensecuritytraining.info/LifeOfBinaries.html)
		* Topics include but are not limited to: 
			* Scanning and tokenizing source code. 
			* Parsing a grammar.  
			* Different targets for x86 assembly object files generation. (E.g. relocatable vs. position independent code).  
			* Linking object files together to create a well-formed binary.  
			* Detailed descriptions of the high level similarities and low level differences between the Windows PE and Linux ELF binary formats. (NOTE: we didn't get to this in the class where the video was recorded, but the materials are in the slides)
			* How an OS loads a binary into memory and links it on the fly before executing it.   
			* Along the way we discuss the relevance of security at different stages of a binary’s life, from the tricks that can be played by a malicious compiler, to how viruses really work, to the way which malware “packers” duplicate OS process execution functionality, to the benefit of a security-enhanced OS loader which implements address space layout randomization (ASLR).

		* Hacker101 is structured as a set of video lessons -- some covering multiple topics, some covering a single one -- and can be consumed in two different ways. You can either watch them in the order produced as in a normal class ([§](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/hacker101#sessions) Sessions), or you can watch individual videos ([§](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/hacker101#vulnerabilities) Vulnerabilities). If you're new to security, we recommend the former; this provides a guided path through the content and covers more than just individual bugs.

Hints and solutions are provided along the way. Although the backend for this is written in PHP, vulnerabilities would remain the same across all web based languages, so the training would still be relevant even if you don’t actively code in PHP.
