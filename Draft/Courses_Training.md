	* [Windows Exploitation, CSCI Spring 2014](http://security.cs.rpi.edu/~gaasem/winexp/IndependentStudy.pdf)
		* Abstract: As of January 2014, the Microsoft Windows operating system series maintains over a 90% market share in the global market of computing1 . This fact alone helps explain why Windows is the most commonly targeted platform for malicious exploitation by hackers, organizations, and nation states alike. With years of relentless exploitation, great strides have been made by Microsoft in securing their operating system through numerous exploit mitigation techniques from the Windows XP era onwards. This course will explore the tools, a number of mitigations, and their associated bypass techniques that are utilized in most modern exploits on the Windows platform. The outcome of this course will leave one with the ability to analyze real world vulnerabilities and develop reliable exploits from end to end for Windows XP – Windows 7 systems.

			* Twenty years ago Abelson and Sussman’s Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs radically changed the intellectual landscape of introductory computing courses. Instead of teaching some currently fashionable programming language, it employed Scheme and functional programming to teach important ideas. Introductory courses based on the book showed up around the world and made Scheme and functional programming popular. Unfortunately, these courses quickly disappeared again due to shortcomings of the book and the whimsies of Scheme. Worse, the experiment left people with a bad impression of Scheme and functional programming in general. In this pearl, we propose an alternative role for functional programming in the first-year curriculum. Specifically, we present a framework for discussing the first-year curriculum and, based on it, the design rationale for our book and course, dubbed How to Design Programs. The approach emphasizes the systematic design of programs. Experience shows that it works extremely well as a preparation for a course on object-oriented programming

	* **Secure Coding**
		* [Introduction to Secure Coding - Andrew Buttner, Larry Shields](http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroSecureCoding.html)
			* The purpose of this course is to provide developers with a short, focused primer related to secure coding.  The hope is that each developer will leave the course with a better understanding of how they can improve, from a security perspective, the code that they write.  This course provides a look at some of the most prevalent security related coding mistakes made in industry today.  Each type of issue is explained in depth including how a malicious user may attack the code, and strategies for avoiding the issues are then reviewed.  Knowledge of at least one programming language is required, although the specific programming language is not important as the concepts that will be discussed are language independent.  The course will cover many of the weaknesses within the context of a web application, but most of the concepts will apply to all application development.
		* [Secure Code Review - Andrew Buttner, Mark Davidson](http://opensecuritytraining.info/SecureCodeReview.html)
			* This course is designed to help developers bring a secure coding mindset into typical project peer reviews. The course briefly talks about the development lifecycle and the importance of peer reviews in delivering a quality product. How to perform this review is discussed and how to keep secure coding a priority during the review is stressed. A variety of hands-on exercises will address common coding mistakes, what to focus on during a review, and how to manage limited time. Throughout the course, the class will break out into pairs and perform example peer reviews on sample code. Perl will be used for the hands-on exercises; however every attempt will be made to generalize the code such that anyone with an understanding of a coding language will be comfortable.

	* [The Life of Binaries](http://opensecuritytraining.info/LifeOfBinaries.html)
		* Topics include but are not limited to: 
			* Scanning and tokenizing source code. 
			* Parsing a grammar.  
			* Different targets for x86 assembly object files generation. (E.g. relocatable vs. position independent code).  
			* Linking object files together to create a well-formed binary.  
			* Detailed descriptions of the high level similarities and low level differences between the Windows PE and Linux ELF binary formats. (NOTE: we didn't get to this in the class where the video was recorded, but the materials are in the slides)
			* How an OS loads a binary into memory and links it on the fly before executing it.   
			* Along the way we discuss the relevance of security at different stages of a binary’s life, from the tricks that can be played by a malicious compiler, to how viruses really work, to the way which malware “packers” duplicate OS process execution functionality, to the benefit of a security-enhanced OS loader which implements address space layout randomization (ASLR).

	* [Binary Analysis Course - Max Kersten](https://maxkersten.nl/binary-analysis-course/)
		* This course starts at the very start, where it is assumed that the reader has little to no low level knowledge. It is expected that the reader is able to understand basic programming aspects such as functions/methods, variables, types and system calls. Unlike most courses, this course aims to only use free and open-source software. This way, everybody can participate and follow the course, whereas most other courses are focused on proprietary tools which cost up to thousands of dollars. This won’t exclude such tools from being used in additional examples later on, but they will not be used as the sole tool in an example. As the course progresses, the material gets more in-depth and complex. Throughout the chapters, there are practical cases included. These cases serve two purposes. Firstly, the reader is greeted with a puzzle every once in a while, instead of pure theory. Secondly, it provides insight in the reader’s learning curve with the help of a given case.

	* [Program Obfuscation, Fall 2013 - CSCI](http://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/obfuscation-fall2013/syllabus.pdf)
		* The issue of program protection has never been more relevant. Commerical software companies need techniques to protect their intellectual property, malware authors try to slow the down the process of reversing and detecting their creations, and nation-states are creating cyber-weapons that they do not want reverse engineered and repurposed. Program protection is has two main approaches, tamper-resistance and obfuscation. Tamperresistance focuses on the detection and corruption of tools used to analyze programs. Obfuscation focuses on making a program hard to understand, even when under flawless analysis tools. Tamper-resistance techniques tend to be an arms race, of one off tricks versus analysis tool updates. Obfuscation offers a much more stable and provably secure avenue in which to protect programs. Obfuscation is thorougly grounded in the formal methods and proofs of cryptography. The only distinction between obfuscation and cryptography is the location of the key. In cryptography, the key is outside the system or data under analysis. In obfuscation, the obfuscated data and key are together, making it a challenging problem of its own. It is the difficulty of provable security and the great need program protection in the current day, that make this class relevant and necessary. In this readings class, we will focus on 15 of the most important works in program obfuscation. We will attain thorough understanding of these papers through paper reviews, discussion, and a project implementing an obfuscation scheme from one of the papers.
	* [Advanced Binary Deobfuscation(2020)](https://github.com/malrev/ABD)
		* This repository contains the course materials of Advanced Binary Deobfuscation at the Global Cybersecurity Camp (GCC) Tokyo in 2020. Reverse engineering is not easy, especially if a binary code is obfuscated. Once obfuscation performed, the binary would not be analyzed accurately with naive techniques alone. In this course, you will learn obfuscation principles (especially used by malware), theory and practice of obfuscated code analysis, and how to write your own tool for deobfuscation. In particular, we delve into data-flow analysis and SAT/SMT-based binary analysis (e.g., symbolic execution) to render obfuscation ineffective.

	* [Security Training for Engineers - Pagerduty](https://sudo.pagerduty.com/for_engineers/)
		* This is an open-source version of "Security Training for Engineers", PagerDuty's internal technical security training, open to all PagerDuty employees as part of our continuous security training program. Unlike our course for everyone, this course covers more technical topics and is more applicable to those in an engineering role. While it delves into various technical topics, it has been designed in such a way as it should be useful regardless of your skill level, whether you've just started your engineering career, or you've been doing this for years. While some of the material we present internally contains sensitive PagerDuty information, the majority consists of generic security lessons, presented in a light-hearted and informative way. Many employees asked for a version of the training they could share with friends and family. This site is the culmination of our efforts to do just that.
* **Threat Hunting**<a name='th'></a>
	* [Flow Analysis & Network Hunting](http://opensecuritytraining.info/Flow.html)
		* This course focuses on network analysis and hunting of malicious activity from a security operations center perspective.

			* We started hacking a couple of years back, competing in capture the flag competitions. Hacking through the weekends and winning prizes sure was a lot of fun. But it‘s nothing compared to the joy of teaching offensive security to students and observing them surpass themselves every week. For multiple semesters now, we‘re teaching hacking to undergraduate students. Somehow we managed to make our course the most attended one in the whole bachelor program. Our lecture doesn't follow teacher centered methods, but utilizes problem based learning and lessons learned from capture the flag competitions. Since teaching also means learning, we worked in a lot of feedback from our students and aligned the contents of the course. In this talk we‘ll explain how to learn and teach this challenging topic, how to correctly use problem based learning in teaching and how to avoid typical pitfalls.

			* Evidence for the superiority of guided instruction is explained in the context of our knowledge of human cognitive architecture, expert–novice differences, and cognitive load. Although unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches are very popular and intuitively appealing, the point is made that these approaches ignore both the structures that constitute human cognitive architecture and evidence from empirical studies over the past half-century that consistently indicate that minimally guided instruction is less effective and less efficient than instructional approaches that place a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning process. The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide “internal” guidance. Recent developments in instructional research and instructional designmodels that support guidance during instruction are briefly described.

			* The prevailing image of the computer represents it as a logical machine and computer programming as a technical, mathematical activity. Both the popular and technical culture have constructed computation as the ultimate embodiment of the abstract and formal. Yet the computer's intellectual personality has another side: our research finds diversity in the practice of computing that is denied by its social construction. When we looked closely at programmers in action we saw formal and abstract approaches; but we also saw highly successful programmers in relationships with their material that are more reminiscent of a painter than a logician. They use concrete and personal approaches to knowledge that are far from the cultural stereotypes of formal mathematics.'
		* ["How to teach programming (and other things)?" by Felienne Hermans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ&app=desktop)
			* Everyone should learn programming, right? Yes! But how... Should we allow children to explore and learn about syntax on their own, or should we drill programming like we rote memorize the table of multiplication or German grammatical cases? Felienne's talk outlines this history of programming education and didactics beliefs in programming that lead to the prevalence of exploratory forms of teaching, starting with Papert's LOGO. She will then explore programming education in relation to mathematics and language education and explore how rote learning could look like for programming. Felienne will discuss her own research into misconceptions and code phonology as means to teach programming more effectively.
