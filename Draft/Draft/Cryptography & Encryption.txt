Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.

[Get Your Hands Off My Laptop: Physical Side-Channel Key-Extraction Attacks On PCs](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff/)
* We demonstrated physical side-channel attacks on a popular software implementation of RSA and ElGamal, running on laptop computers. Our attacks use novel side channels and are based on the observation that the "ground" electric potential in many computers fluctuates in a computation-dependent way. An attacker can measure this signal by touching exposed metal on the computer's chassis with a plain wire, or even with a bare hand. The signal can also be measured at the remote end of Ethernet, VGA or USB cables. Through suitable cryptanalysis and signal processing, we have extracted 4096-bit RSA keys and 3072-bit ElGamal keys from laptops, via each of these channels, as well as via power analysis and electromagnetic probing. Despite the GHz-scale clock rate of the laptops and numerous noise sources, the full attacks require a few seconds of measurements using Medium Frequency signals (around 2 MHz), or one hour using Low Frequency signals (up to 40 kHz).


[Why does cryptographic software fail? A case study and open problems](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/cryptobugs:apsys14.pdf)
* Abstract: Mistakes in cryptographic software implementations often undermine the strong security guarantees offered by cryptography. This paper presents a systematic study of cryptographic vulnerabilities in practice, an examination of state-of-the-art techniques to prevent such vulnerabilities, and a discussion of open problems and possible future research directions. Our study covers 269 cryptographic vulnerabilities reported in the CVE database from January 2011 to May 2014. The results show that just 17% of the bugs are in cryptographic libraries (which often have devastating consequences), and the remaining 83% are misuses of cryptographic libraries by individual applications. We observe that preventing bugs in different parts of a system requires different techniques, and that no effective techniques exist to deal with certain classes of mistakes, such as weak key generation.

[RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/)

The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts.

[Toward Robust Hidden Volumes Using Write-Only Oblivious RAM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/344.pdf) 
* With sensitive data being increasingly stored on mobile devices and laptops, hard disk encryption is more important than ever. In partic- ular, being able to plausibly deny that a hard disk contains certain information is a very useful and interesting research goal. However, it has been known for some time that existing “hidden volume” so- lutions, like TrueCrypt, fail in the face of an adversary who is able to observe the contents of a disk on multiple, separate occasions. In this work, we explore more robust constructions for hidden vol- umes and present HIVE, which is resistant to more powerful ad- versaries with multiple-snapshot capabilities. In pursuit of this, we propose the first security definitions for hidden volumes, and prove HIVE secure under these definitions. At the core of HIVE, we de- sign a new write-only Oblivious RAM. We show that, when only hiding writes, it is possible to achieve ORAM with optimal O (1) communication complexity and only poly-logarithmic user mem- ory.  This is a significant improvement over existing work and an independently interesting result.  We go on to show that our write- only ORAM is specially equipped to provide hidden volume func- tionality with low overhead and significantly increased security. Fi- nally, we implement HIVE as a Linux kernel block device to show both its practicality and usefulness on existing platforms.

[A Messy State of the Union: Taming the Composite State Machines of TLS](https://www.smacktls.com/smack.pdf)
* Abstract —Implementations of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol must handle a variety of protocol versions and extensions, authentication modes and key exchange methods, where each combination may prescribe a different message sequence between the client and the server. We address the problem of designing a robust composite state machine that can correctly multiplex between these different protocol modes. We systematically test popular open-source TLS implementations for state machine bugs and discover several critical security vulnerabilities that have lain hidden in these libraries for years (they are now in the process of being patched). We argue that these vulnerabilities stem from incorrect compositions of individually correct state machines. We present the first verified implementation of a composite TLS state machine in C that can be embedded into OpenSSL and accounts for all its supported ciphersuites. Our attacks expose the need for the formal verifica- tion of core components in cryptographic protocol libraries; our implementation demonstrates that such mechanized proofs are within reach, even for mainstream TLS implementations.

[Indistinguishability Obfuscation from the Multilinear Subgroup Elimination Assumption](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/309)
*  Abstract: We revisit the question of constructing secure general-purpose indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), with a security reduction based on explicit computational assumptions over multi- linear maps. Previous to our work, such reductions were only known to exist based on meta- assumptions and/or ad-hoc assumptions: In the original constructive work of Garg et al. (FOCS 2013), the underlying explicit computational assumption encapsulated an exponential family of assumptions for each pair of circuits to be obfuscated. In the more recent work of Pass et al. (Crypto 2014), the underlying assumption is a meta-assumption that also encapsulates an exponential family of assumptions, and this meta-assumption is invoked in a manner that captures the specific pair of circuits to be obfuscated. The assumptions underlying both these works substantially capture (either explicitly or implicitly) the actual structure of the obfuscation mechanism itself.  In our work, we provide the first construction of general-purpose indistinguishability obfuscation proven secure via a reduction to a natural computational assumption over multilinear maps, namely, the Multilinear Subgroup Elimination Assumption. This assumption does not depend on the circuits to be obfuscated (except for its size), and does not correspond to the underlying structure of our obfuscator. The technical heart of our paper is our reduction, which gives a new way to argue about the security of indistinguishability obfuscation.

[Real-time Steganography with RTP](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=36&t=sumry)
* Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP) is used by nearly all Voice-over-IP systems to provide the audio channel for calls. As such, it provides ample opportunity for the creation of a covert communication channel due to its very nature. While use of steganographic techniques with various audio cover-medium has been extensively researched, most applications of such have been limited to audio cover-medium of a static nature such as WAV or MP3 file audio data. This paper details a common technique for the use of steganography with audio data cover-medium, outlines the problem issues that arise when attempting to use such techniques to establish a full-duplex communications channel within audio data transmitted via an unreliable streaming protocol, and documents solutions to these problems. An implementation of the ideas discussed entitled SteganRTP is included in the reference materials.
