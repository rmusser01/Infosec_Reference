Better security - Mean time to detect/Mean time to respond

[Fully Integrated Defense Operation (FIDO)](https://github.com/Netflix/Fido)
* FIDO is an orchestration layer used to automate the incident response process by evaluating, assessing and responding to malware. FIDO’s primary purpose is to handle the heavy manual effort needed to evaluate threats coming from today's security stack and the large number of alerts generated by them. As an orchestration platform FIDO can make using your existing security tools more efficient and accurate by heavily reducing the manual effort needed to detect, notify and respond to attacks against a network.

[IRMA - Incident Response & Malware Analysis](http://irma.quarkslab.com/index.html)
* IRMA intends to be an open-source platform designed to help identifying and analyzing malicious files.  However, today's defense is not only about learning about a file, but it is also getting a fine overview of the incident you dealt with: where / when a malicious file has been seen, who submitted a hash, where a hash has been noticed, which anti-virus detects it, ...  An important value with IRMA comes from you keep control over where goes / who gets your data. Once you install IRMA on your network, your data stays on your network.  Each submitted files is analyzed in various ways. For now, we focus our efforts on multiple anti-virus engines, but we are working on other "probes" (feel free to submit your own).

[triage-ir](https://code.google.com/p/triage-ir/)
* Triage: Incident Response automatically collect information from a system that needs basic triage functions performed upon it. The script allows for easy modification for customization to your needs, in an easy to comprehend and implement language. This tool uses a lot others to get its information. Eventually I hope to eliminate the need for them, but use them as verification. This tool requires you to download the Sysinternals Suite if you want full functionality to it.

We'll demonstrate how to collect and interpret these forensic artifacts, both on individual hosts and at scale across the enterprise. Throughout the presentation, we'll include examples from real-world incidents and recommendations on how to limit exposure to these attacks.

[StegExpose](https://github.com/b3dk7/StegExpose)
* StegExpose is a steganalysis tool specialized in detecting LSB (least significant bit) steganography in lossless images such as PNG and BMP. It has a command line interface and is designed to analyse images in bulk while providing reporting capabilities and customization which is comprehensible for non forensic experts. StegExpose rating algorithm is derived from an intelligent and thoroughly tested combination of pre-existing pixel based staganalysis methods including Sample Pairs by Dumitrescu (2003), RS Analysis by Fridrich (2001), Chi Square Attack by Westfeld (2000) and Primary Sets by Dumitrescu (2002). In addition to detecting the presence of steganography, StegExpose also features the quantitative steganalysis (determining the length of the hidden message). StegExpose is part of my MSc of a project at the School of Computing of the University of Kent, in Canterbury, UK.

[WinPrefetchView v1.25](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/win_prefetch_view.html)
* Each time that you run an application in your system, a Prefetch file which contains information about the files loaded by the application is created by Windows operating system. The information in the Prefetch file is used for optimizing the loading time of the application in the next time that you run it. WinPrefetchView is a small utility that reads the Prefetch files stored in your system and display the information stored in them. By looking in these files, you can learn which files every application is using, and which files are loaded on Windows boot. 
[BTA - AD Security Audit Framework](https://bitbucket.org/iwseclabs/bta)

Who has rights over a given object (computer, user account, etc.) ?
Who can read a given mailbox ?
Which are the accounts with domain admin rights ?
Who has extended rights (userForceChangePassword, SendAs, etc.) ?
What are the changes done on an AD between two points in time ?

[Event Tracing for Windows and Network Monitor](http://blogs.technet.com/b/netmon/archive/2009/05/13/event-tracing-for-windows-and-network-monitor.aspx)
* "Event Tracing for Windows, (ETW), has been around for quite a while now as it was introduced in Windows 2000. It's basically instrumented logging that describes what a component is doing. Conceptually, it’s something like the proverbial printf("here1") concept used by programmers, but it is present in retail builds. When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL (Event Trace Log) file. What’s new is that that Network Monitor can read any ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers can be decoded."

[File Signature Table](http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html)
* This table of file signatures (aka "magic numbers") is a continuing work-in-progress. I have found little information on this in a single place, with the exception of the table in Forensic Computing: A Practitioner's Guide by T. Sammes & B. Jenkinson (Springer, 2000); that was my inspiration to start this list in 2002. See also Wikipedia's List of file signatures. Comments, additions, and queries can be sent to Gary Kessler at gck@garykessler.net.

[Xmount](https://www.pinguin.lu/xmount)
* What is xmount? xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple input and output harddisk image types. xmount creates a virtual file system using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation of the input image. The virtual representation can be in raw DD, DMG, VHD, VirtualBox's virtual disk file format or in VmWare's VMDK file format. Input images can be raw DD, EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format) or AFF (Advanced Forensic Format) files. In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output files that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it possible to boot acquired harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.
