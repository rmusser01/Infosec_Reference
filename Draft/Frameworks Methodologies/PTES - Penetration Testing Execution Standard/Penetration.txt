Penetration

    Penetration - An exploit usually relates to the existence of some flaw or vulnerability in an application or operating system that if used could lead to privilege escalation or denial of service against the computer system that is being attacked. Exploits can be compiled and used manually or various engines exist that are essentially at the lowest level pre-compiled point and shoot tools. These engines do also have a number of other extra underlying features for more advanced users.
