* [A Verified Information-Flow Architecture](http://www.crash-safe.org/assets/verified-ifc-long-draft-2013-11-10.pdf)
	* SAFE is a clean-slate design for a highly secure computer system, with pervasive mechanisms for tracking and limiting information flows. At the lowest level, the SAFE hardware supports fine-grained programmable tags, with efficient and flexible propagation and combination of tags as instructions are executed. The operating system virtualizes these generic facilities to present an information-flow abstract machine that allows user programs to label sensitive data with rich confidentiality policies. We present a formal, machine-checked model of the key hardware and software mechanisms used to control information flow in SAFE and an end- to-end proof of noninterference for this model.
* [SimpleVisor](https://github.com/ionescu007/SimpleVisor)
	* SimpleVisor is a simple, portable, Intel VT-x hypervisor with two specific goals: using the least amount of assembly code (10 lines), and having the smallest amount of VMX-related code to support dynamic hyperjacking and unhyperjacking (that is, virtualizing the host state from within the host). It works on Windows and UEFI.
* [Adapting Software Fault Isolation to Contemporary CPU Architectures](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/35649.pdf)
	* Software Fault Isolation (SFI) is an effective approach to sandboxing binary code of questionable provenance, an interesting use case for native plugins in a Web browser. We present software fault isolation schemes for ARM and x86-64 that provide control-flow and memory integrity with average performance overhead of under 5% on ARM and 7% on x86-64. We believe these are the best known SFI implementations for these architectures, with significantly lower overhead than previous systems for similar architectures. Our experience suggests that these SFI implementations benefit from instruction-level parallelism, and have particularly small impact for work- loads that are data memory-bound, both properties that tend to reduce the impact of our SFI systems for future CPU implementations.

* [Pulling Back the Curtain on Airport Security: Can a Weapon Get Past TSA? - Billy Rios - BHUSA 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=hbqVNlwfjxo)
	* Every day, millions of people go through airport security. While it is an inconvenience that could take a while, most are willing to follow the necessary procedures if it can guarantee their safety. Modern airport security checkpoints use sophisticated technology to help the security screeners identify potential threats and suspicious baggage. Have you ever wondered how these devices work? Have you ever wondered why an airport security checkpoint was set up in a particular configuration? Join us as we present the details on how a variety of airport security systems actually work, and reveal their weaknesses. We’ll present what we have learned about modern airport security procedures, dive deep into the devices used to detect threats, and we’ll present some the bugs we discovered along the way.

		* Description: This paper is broken up into several distinct parts, all related loosely to timing and its role in information se- curity today. While timing has long been recognized as an important component in the crypt-analysts arse- nal, it has not featured very prominently in the domain of Application Security Testing. This paper aims at highlighting some of the areas in which timing can be used with great effect, where traditional avenues fail. In this paper, a brief overview of previous timing attacks is provided, the use of timing as a covert channel is examined and the effectiveness of careful timing during traditional web application and SQL injection attacks is demonstrated. The use of Cross Site Timing in bypass- ing the Same Origin policy is explored as we believe the technique has interesting possibilities for turning innocent browsers into bot-nets aimed at, for instance, brute-force attacks against third party web-sites

		* "Rowhammer” is a problem with some recent DRAM devices in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows. We tested a selection of laptops and found that a subset of them exhibited the problem. We built two working privilege escalation exploits that use this effect. One exploit uses rowhammer-induced bit flips to gain kernel privileges on x86-64 Linux when run as an unprivileged userland process. When run on a machine vulnerable to the rowhammer problem, the process was able to induce bit flips in page table entries (PTEs). It was able to use this to gain write access to its own page table, and hence gain read-write access to all of physical memory.

Our attack combines a large number of short instruction sequences to build gadgets that allow arbitrary computation. We show how to discover such instruction sequences by means of static analysis. We make use, in an essential way, of the properties of the x86 instruction set.

		* 2D barcodes offer many benefits compared to 1D barcodes, such as high information density and robustness. Before their introduction to the mobile phone ecosystem, they have been widely used in specific applications, such as logistics or ticketing. However, there are multiple competing standards with different benefits and drawbacks. Therefore, reader applications as well as dedicated devices have to support multiple standards. In this paper, we present novel attacks based on deliberately caused ambiguities when especially crafted barcodes conform to multiple standards. Implementation details decide which standard the decoder locks on. This way, two users scanning the same barcode with different phones or apps will receive different content. This potentially opens way for multiple problems related to security. We describe how embedding one barcode symbology into another can be used to perform phishing attacks as well as targeted exploits. In addition, we evaluate the extent to which popular 2D barcode reader applications on smartphones are susceptible to these barcode-in-barcode attacks. We furthermore discuss mitigation techniques against this type of attack.

		* Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.
	* [Get Your Hands Off My Laptop: Physical Side-Channel Key-Extraction Attacks On PCs](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff/)
		* We demonstrated physical side-channel attacks on a popular software implementation of RSA and ElGamal, running on laptop computers. Our attacks use novel side channels and are based on the observation that the "ground" electric potential in many computers fluctuates in a computation-dependent way. An attacker can measure this signal by touching exposed metal on the computer's chassis with a plain wire, or even with a bare hand. The signal can also be measured at the remote end of Ethernet, VGA or USB cables. Through suitable cryptanalysis and signal processing, we have extracted 4096-bit RSA keys and 3072-bit ElGamal keys from laptops, via each of these channels, as well as via power analysis and electromagnetic probing. Despite the GHz-scale clock rate of the laptops and numerous noise sources, the full attacks require a few seconds of measurements using Medium Frequency signals (around 2 MHz), or one hour using Low Frequency signals (up to 40 kHz).

		* Abstract: Software security practitioners are often torn between choosing per- formance or security. In particular, OS kernels are sensitive to the smallest performance regressions. This makes it difficult to develop innovative kernel hardening mechanisms: they may inevitably incur some run-time performance overhead. Here, we propose building each kernel function with and without hardening, within a single split kernel . In particular, this allows trusted processes to be run under unmodified kernel code, while system calls of untrusted pro- cesses are directed to the hardened kernel code. We show such trusted processes run with no overhead when compared to an un- modified kernel. This allows deferring the decision of making use of hardening to the run-time. This means kernel distributors, system administrators and users can selectively enable hardening accord- ing to their needs: we give examples of such cases. Although this approach cannot be directly applied to arbitrary kernel hardening mechanisms, we show cases where it can. Finally, our implementa- tion in the Linux kernel requires few changes to the kernel sources and no application source changes. Thus, it is both maintainable and easy to use

		* This paper studies an emerging class of software bugs called optimization-unstable code: code that is unexpectedly discarded by compiler optimizations due to undefined behavior in the program. Unstable code is present in many systems, including the Linux kernel and the Postgres database. The consequences of unstable code range from incorrect functionality to missing security checks. To reason about unstable code, this paper proposes a novel model, which views unstable code in terms of optimizations that leverage undefined behavior. Using this model, we introduce a new static checker called Stack that precisely identifies unstable code. Applying Stack to widely used systems has uncovered 160 new bugs that have been confirmed and fixed by developers

		* This installation of What Were They Thinking illustrates some of the annoyances that can be caused when developing software that has to inter-operate with third-party applications. Two such cases will be dissected and discussed in detail for the purpose of showing how third-party applications can fail when used in conjunction with software that performs certain tasks. The analysis of the two cases is meant to show how complex failure conditions can be analyzed and used to determine inter-operability problems.

		* Abstract: The concept of Ceremony is introduced as an extension of the concept of network protocol, with human nodes alongside computer nodes and with communication links that include UI, human-to-human communication and transfers of physical objects that carry data. What is out-of-band to a protocol is in-band to a ceremony, and therefore subject to design and analysis using variants of the same mature techniques used for the design and analysis of protocols. Ceremonies include all protocols, as well as all applications with a user interface, all workflow and all provisioning scenarios. A secure ceremony is secure against both normal attacks and social engineering. However, some secure protocols imply ceremonies that cannot be made secure.

		* In this paper I will uncover the information exchange of what may be classified as one of the highest money making schemes coordinated by 'organized crime'. I will elaborate on information gathered from a third party individual directly involved in all aspects of the scheme at play. I will provide a detailed explanation of this market's origin, followed by a brief description of some of the actions strategically performed by these individuals in order to ensure their success. Finally, I will elaborate on real world examples of how a single person can be labeled a spammer, malware author, cracker, and an entrepreneur gone thief. For the purposes of avoiding any legal matters, and unwanted media, I will refrain from mentioning the names of any individuals and corporations who are involved in the schemes described in this paper. 
	* [Seven Months’ Worth of Mistakes: A Longitudinal Study of Typosquatting Abuse](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/471369/3/typos-final.pdf)
		* Abstract: Typosquatting is the act of purposefully registering a domain name that is a mistype of a popular domain name. It is a concept that has been known and studied for over 15 years, yet still thoroughly practiced up until this day. While previous typosquatting studies have always taken a snapshot of the typosquatting landscape or base their longitudinal results only on domain registration data, we present the first content- based , longitudinal study of typosquatting. We collected data about the typosquatting domains of the 500 most popular sites of the Internet every day, for a period of seven months, and we use this data to establish whether previously discovered typosquatting trends still hold today, and to provide new results and insights in the typosquatting landscape. In particular we reveal that, even though 95% of the popular domains we investigated are actively targeted by typosquatters, only few trademark owners protect themselves against this practice by proactively registering their own typosquatting domains. We take advantage of the longitudinal aspect of our study to show, among other results, that typosquatting domains change hands from typosquatters to legitimate owners and vice versa, and that typosquatters vary their monetization strategy by hosting different types of pages over time. Our study also reveals that a large fraction of typosquatting domains can be traced back to a small group of typosquatting page hosters and that certain top-level domains are much more prone to typosquatting than others

	* [A Practical Methodology for Measuring the Side-Channel Signal Available to the Attacker for Instruction-Level Event](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~az30/Downloads/Micro14.pdf)
		* Abstract: This paper presents a new metric, which we call Signal Available to Attacker (SAVAT), that measures the side channel signal created by a specific single-instruction difference in program execution, i.e. the amount of signal made available to a potential attacker who wishes to decide whether the program has executed instruction/event A or instruction/event B. We also devise a practical methodology for measuring SAVAT in real systems using only user-level access permissions and common measurement equipment. Finally, we perform a case study where we measure electromagnetic (EM) emanations SAVAT among 11 different instructions for three different laptop systems. Our findings from these experiments confirm key intuitive expectations, e.g. that SAVAT between on-chip instructions and off-chip memory accesses tends to be higher than between two on-chip instructions. However, we find that particular instructions, such as integer divide, have much higher SAVAT than other instructions in the same general category (integer arithmetic), and that last-level-cache hits and misses have similar (high) SAVAT. Overall, we confirm that our new metric and methodology can help discover the most vulnerable aspects of a processor architecture or a program, and thus inform decision-making about how to best manage the overall side channel vulnerability of a processor, a program, or a system.

* **Interesting Talks**
	* [You and Your Research - Haroon Meer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoVx_-bM8Tg)
		* What does it take to do quality research? What stops you from being a one-hit wonder? Is there an age limit to productive hackery? What are the key ingredients needed and how can you up your chances of doing great work? In a talk unabashedly stolen from far greater minds we hope to answer these questions and discuss their repercussions.
	* [Bootstrapping A Security Research Project Andrew Hay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNU2J-IcK4E)
		* It has become increasingly common to see a headline in the mainstream media talking about the latest car, television, or other IoT device being hacked (hopefully by a researcher). In each report, blog, or presentation, we learn about the alarming lack of security and privacy associated with the device's hardware, communications mechanisms, software/app, and hosting infrastructure in addition to how easy it might be for an attacker to take advantage of one, or multiple, threat vectors. The truth is, anyone can perform this kind of research if given the right guidance. To many security professionals, however, the act of researching something isn,t the problem...it's what to research, how to start, and when to stop. Academics think nothing of researching something until they feel it's "done" (or their funding/tenure runs out). Security professionals, however, often do not have that luxury. This session will discuss how to research, well, ANYTHING. Proven methods for starting, continuing, ending, leading, and collaborating on reproducible research will be discussed - taking into account real-world constraints such as time, money, and a personal life. We will also discuss how to generate data, design your experiments, analyze your results, and present (and in some cases defend) your research to the public.
	* [A talk about (info-sec) talks - Haroon Meer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlVjdUkrSFY)
		* Last year there was an Information Security conference taking place for almost every day of the year. This translates to about 15 information security talks per day, every day. The question is, is this a bad thing? Even niche areas of the info-sec landscape have their own dedicated conference these days. Is this a good thing?

		* Have you ever wanted to kill someone? Do you want to get rid of your partner, your boss or your arch nemesis? Perhaps you want to enjoy your life insurance payout whilst you’re still alive. Do you have rich elderly parents that just won’t die quick enough? Or do you want a “Do Over” new identity.  Then, this presentation is for you! I’ll provide you with the insight and techniques on how to “kill” someone and obtain a real death certificate and shutdown their lives. It focuses on the lack of security controls that allow any of us to virtually kill off anyone or any number of people. Forget the Dexter way of killing someone, I’ll show you how to avoid the messy clean up and focusing in on the digital aspects. You could be dead right now and not even know it.

		* When do you, and other coders, hackers, developers, and tinkerers, think or worry about the law? If your answer is, ?Not very often,? then this talk is for you. We all need to think about the law. And it's not just privacy, or computer fraud, or even anti-circumvention law, that we should think about. We need to think about law as a whole and how it can help us do or stop us from doing what we want to do. This talk will start with a broad overview of the ways in which we implicate law when we do what we do, and then will focus on what that means for us and the broader implications that can arise from our various activities. Do you think the law would stop you from doing what you want to do or punish you for doing it? It might, but it also might not. If you think it does, do you think you should be able to do what you want to do? If you do, then we need to hack the law, and to do that we?ll need to talk to the legal coders, those writers of our cultural software. This talk will tackle not only law and working with code, but also why it matters for us to be aware of the law and engaged in improving it.

		* Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact on life, work, and relationships of building a different map of reality than “normal people” use. One has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. One has to live defensively, warily. This causes at the least cognitive dissonance which some manage by denial. But refusing to feel the pain does not make it go away. It just intensifies the consequences when they erupt. Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, does not go away. When cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one’s peril. But the very constraints of one’s work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one’s clearances, work, and career. And whistle blower protection is often non-existent.

Rigging polls, abusing Twitter, causing Reddit riots & targeting popular news organisations are some of the (many) attacks covered. In all these cases we discuss what we tried, what worked, what didn’t and what the implications are of the attacks. Where possible we will cover defences and solutions.

		* Networks don't need to be hacked for information to be compromised. This is particularly true for organizations that are trying to keep trade secrets. While we hear a lot about personal privacy, little is said in regard to organizational privacy. Organizations, in fact, leak information at a much greater rate than individuals, and usually do so with little fanfare. There are greater consequences for organizations when information is leaked because the secrets often fall into the hands of competitors. This talk uses a variety of real world examples to show how trade secrets are leaked online, and how organizational privacy is compromised by seemingly innocent use of The Internet.

		* In this presentation I am sharing the results of a three-year, industry-wide study on open source development and security practices across 3,000 organizations and 25,000. I will detail how these organizations are employing a vast community of open source component suppliers, warehouses, and development tools that take the form of software supply chains. Modern software development practices are now consuming BILLIONS of open source and third-party components. The tooling with package managers and build tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, NuGet, RubyGems and others has promoted the usage of components to a convenient standard practice. As a result, 90% of a typical application is now composed of open source components. The good news: use of the components is improving developer productivity and accelerating time to market. However, using these components brings ownership and responsibility with it and this fact is largely overlooked. The unspoken truth: not all parts are created equal. For example, 1 in 16 components in use include known security vulnerabilities. Ugh. This session aims to enlighten development professionals by sharing results from the State of the Software Supply Chain reports from 2015 through 2017. The reports blend of public and proprietary data with expert research and analysis. Attendees in this session will learn: - What our analysis of 25,000 applications reveals about the quality and security of software built with open source components - How organizations like Mayo Clinic, Exxon, Capital One, the U.S. FDA and Intuit are utilizing the principles of software supply chain automation to improve application security - Why avoiding open source components over 3 years old might be a really good idea - How to balance the need for speed with quality and security -- early in the development lifecycle We will also discuss how you can best approach the effort for development teams to identify, track and replace components with known vulnerabilities, while getting more products and new features to market quickly. Attend this session and gain insight as to how your organization’s application development practices compare to others. I'll share the industry benchmarks to take back and discuss with your development, security, and open source governance teams.

	* [(In)Outsider Trading – Hacking stocks using public information and (influence) - Robert Len - BSides CapeTown16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfHeguTEkuE)
		* This talk will take a look at how inadvertently leaked technical information from businesses, can be used to successfully trade stocks. This results in making huge profits. We look at different methods of influencing the stock market, such as DDOS attacks (at critical time periods) and simple techniques such as Phish-baiting CEO’s to acquire sensitive, relevant information that can be applied in the real world to make massive gains in profit. We will also take a look at historic trends. How previous hacks, breaches and DDOS attacks have affected stock prices and investor confidence over time. Specific reference will be made towards listed South African companies (Or a particular listed SA company) and a POC will hopefully be completed by the presentation date.

		* Every time you look at your inbox, there it is... SPAM! Your penis needs enlargement, a horny single girl from Russia "accidentally" emailed you, and a former Nigerian prince knows that you're just the man to safeguard his millions. But in 2007, while still a student at MIT, one particular kind caught my eye: stock spam. Those bizarre stock market "tips" that claim you should buy a particular stock because it's "about to go through the roof!!!!" Like most people, I initially thought nothing of these ridiculous emails. That was until Kyle Vogt (now of Justin.tv) proposed the stupidest idea I had ever heard: "There has to be some way we can make money off these spammers". After trying, and failing, to prove Kyle wrong, the two of us embarked on a 4-month study into the dark depths of stock spam. In this talk, I'll explain how we went from hand-sorting tens of thousands of spam emails to developing a trading strategy able to take a piece of the spammers' profits. And how, in the process, our work produced data that disproved the results of nearly all the existing stock spam research.

Why do people tend to make the same mistakes again and again (Buffer Overflow, anyone?)? What can we do to prevent security incidents? Which curricula should be taught about IT security?
	* [Killing you softly Josh Bressers](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/circlecitycon2016/302-killing-you-softly-josh-bressers)
		* The entire security industry has a serious skill problem. We,re technically able, but we have no soft skills. We can,t talk to normal people at all. We can barely even talk to each other, and it's killing our industry. Every successful industry relies on the transfer of skills from the experienced to the inexperienced. Security lacks this today. If I asked you how you learned what you know about security, what would your answer be? In most cases you learned everything you know on your own. There was minimal learning from someone else. This has left us with an industry full of magicians, but even worse it puts us in a place where there is no way to transfer skill and knowledge from one generation to the next. Magicians don,t scale. If we think about this in the context of how we engage non security people it's even worse! Most non security people have no idea what security is, what security does, or even why security is important. It's easy to laugh at the horrible security problems almost everything has today, but in reality we,re laughing at ourselves. Historically we,ve blamed everything else for this problem when in reality it's 100% our fault. One of the our great weaknesses is failing to get the regular people to understand security and why it's important. This isn,t a surprise if you think about how the industry communicates. We can barely talk to each other, how can we possibly talk to someone who doesn,t know anything about security? Normal people are confused and scared, they want to do the right thing but they have no idea what that is. The future leaders in security are going to have to be able to teach and talk to their security peers, but more importantly they will have to engage everyone else. Security is being paid attention to like never before, and yet we have nothing to say to anyone. What has changed in the last few years? If we don,t do our jobs, someone else will do them for us, and we,re not going to like the results. Security isn,t a technical problem, technical problems are easy, security is a communication problem. Communications problems are difficult. Let's figure out how we can fix that.

		* For years the government has been using CDS to bridge networks with different classification levels. This talk will focus on what CDS systems are, how they’re built, and what kind of configurations are common in the wild. Furthermore, we’ll look at testing techniques to evaluate the security of these systems and potential ways to exploit holes in configuration and design. We’ll also look at the ways the commercial world might benefit from a data and type-driven firewall as well as some of the downfalls and negative aspects of implementing a cross-domain system.

* ["I want my money back!" Li­mi­t­ing On­line Pass­word-Gues­sing Fi­nan­ci­al­ly -Ma­xi­mi­li­an Golla, Da­ni­el V. Bai­ley, Mar­kus Dür­muth](http://www.mobsec.rub.de/forschung/veroeffentlichungen/limiting-online-password-guessing-financially/)
	* In this work-in-pro­gress re­port, we pro­po­se an opt-in de­po­sit-ba­sed ap­proach to ra­te-li­mi­t­ing that tack­les on­line gues­sing at­tacks. By de­man­ding a small de­po­sit for each login at­tempt, which is im­me­dia­te­ly re­fun­ded after a suc­cess­ful sign in, on­line gues­sing at­ta­ckers face high costs for re­pea­ted un­suc­cess­ful log­ins. We pro­vi­de an in­iti­al ana­ly­sis of sui­ta­ble pay­ment sys­tems and re­a­sonable de­po­sit va­lues for re­al-world im­ple­men­ta­ti­ons and di­s­cuss se­cu­ri­ty and usa­bi­li­ty im­pli­ca­ti­ons of the sys­tem.
* [Emo­ji­Auth: Quan­ti­fy­ing the Se­cu­ri­ty of Emo­ji-ba­sed Au­then­ti­ca­ti­on -  Ma­xi­mi­li­an Golla, Den­nis De­te­ring, Mar­kus Dür­muth](http://www.mobsec.rub.de/forschung/veroeffentlichungen/quantifying-security-emoji-based-authentication/)
	* Mo­bi­le de­vices, such as smart­pho­nes and ta­blets, fre­quent­ly store con­fi­den­ti­al data, yet im­ple­men­ting a se­cu­re de­vice un­lock func­tio­na­li­ty is non-tri­vi­al due to re­stric­ted input me­thods. Gra­phi­cal know­ledge-ba­sed sche­mes have been wi­de­ly used on smart­pho­nes and are ge­ne­ral­ly well ad­ap­ted to the touch­screen in­ter­face on small screens. Re­cent­ly, gra­phi­cal pass­word sche­mes based on emoji have been pro­po­sed. They offer po­ten­ti­al be­ne­fits due to the fa­mi­li­a­ri­ty of users with emoji and the ease of ex­pres­sing me­mo­ra­ble sto­ries. Howe­ver, it is well-known from other gra­phi­cal sche­mes that user-selec­ted au­then­ti­ca­ti­on secrets can sub­stan­ti­al­ly limit the re­sul­ting en­tro­py of the au­then­ti­ca­ti­on secret. In this work, we study the en­tro­py of user-selec­ted secrets for one ex­em­pla­ry in­stan­tia­ti­on of emo­ji-ba­sed au­then­ti­ca­ti­on. We ana­ly­zed an im­ple­men­ta­ti­on using 20 emoji dis­play­ed in ran­dom order on a grid, where a user selects pass­codes of length 4 wi­thout fur­ther re­stric­tions. We con­duc­ted an on­line user study with 795 par­ti­ci­pants, using the collec­ted pass­codes to de­ter­mi­ne the re­sis­tan­ce to gues­sing based on se­ver­al gues­sing stra­te­gies, thus esti­ma­ting the selec­tion bias. We eva­lua­ted Mar­kov mo­del-ba­sed gues­sing stra­te­gies based on the selec­ted se­quence of emoji, on its po­si­ti­on in the grid, and com­bined mo­dels ta­king into ac­count both fea­tures. While we find selec­tion bias based on both the emoji as well as the po­si­ti­on, the me­a­su­red bias is lower than for si­mi­lar sche­mes. De­pen­ding on the model, we can re­co­ver up to 7% at 100 gues­sing at­tempts, and up to 11% of the pass­codes at 1000 gues­sing at­tempts. (For com­pa­ri­son, pre­vious work on the gra­phi­cal An­dro­id Un­lock pat­tern sche­me (CCS 2013) re­co­ver­ed around 18% at 100 and 50% at 1000 gues­sing at­tempts, de­s­pi­te a theo­re­ti­cal key­space of more than dou­b­le the size for the An­dro­id sche­me.) These re­sults de­mons­tra­te some po­ten­ti­al for a usa­ble and re­la­tive­ly se­cu­re sche­me and show that the size of the theo­re­ti­cal key­space is a bad pre­dic­tor for the rea­lis­tic guessa­bi­li­ty of pass­codes.




* **Interesting Software Projects**
	* [Upspin](https://github.com/upspin/upspin)
		* Upspin is an experimental project to build a framework for naming and sharing files and other data securely, uniformly, and globally: a global name system of sorts. It is not a file system, but a set of protocols and reference implementations that can be used to join things like file systems and other storage services to the name space. Performance is not a primary goal. Uniformity and security are. Upspin is not an official Google product
* **Interesting Hardware Projects**
	* [Digital Ding Dong Ditch](https://github.com/samyk/dingdong)
		* Digital Ding Dong Ditch is a device to hack into and ring my best friend's wireless doorbell whenever I send a text message to the device. The best part of the device is that it causes my friend, without fail, to come outside, find no one, and go back in. In this project, we'll learn not only how to create this device, but how to reverse engineer radio frequencies we know nothing about using RTL-SDR (a ~$14 software defined radio), as well as creating hardware and software using Arduino, the Adafruit FONA (GSM/SMS/2G board), an RF (radio frequency) transmitter to transmit custom signals, and even how to reverse engineer a proprietary radio signal we know nothing about!
