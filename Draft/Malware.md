* [rVMI - A New Paradigm For Full System Analysis](https://github.com/fireeye/rvmi)
	* rVMI is a debugger on steroids. It leverages Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) and memory forensics to provide full system analysis. This means that an analyst can inspect userspace processes, kernel drivers, and preboot environments in a single tool.  It was specifially designed for interactive dynamic malware analysis. rVMI isolates itself from the malware by placing its interactive debugging environment out of the virtual machine (VM) onto the hypervisor-level. Through the use of VMI the analyst still has full control of the VM, which allows her to pause the VM at any point in time and to use typical debugging features such as breakpoints and watchpoints. In addtion, rVMI provides access to the entire Rekall feature set, which enables an analyst to inspect the kernel and its data structures with ease.

* [PyTrigger: A System to Trigger & Extract User-Activated Malware Behavior](http://cs.gmu.edu/~astavrou/research/PyTrigger_ARES2013.pdf)
	* Abstract: We introduce PyTrigger, a dynamic malware analy- sis system that automatically exercises a malware binary extract- ing its behavioral profile even when specific user activity or input is required. To accomplish this, we developed a novel user activity record and playback framework and a new  behavior  extraction approach.  Unlike  existing research, the activity recording and playback  includes the context of every object  in  addition  to traditional keyboard and mouse actions. The addition of the con- text makes the playback more accurate and avoids dependenciesand pitfalls that come with pure mouse and keyboard  replay. Moreover,  playback  can  become  more  efficient by condensing common activities into a single action. After playback, PyTrigger analyzes the system trace using a combination of multiple states and  behavior  differencing  to accurately extract  the  malware behavior and user triggered behavior from the complete system trace  log.  We  present the  algorithms, architecture and evaluate the   PyTrigger prototype using 3994 real malware samples. Results and analysis are presented showing PyTrigger extracts additional behavior in 21% of the samples

	* Truman can be used to build a "sandnet", a tool for analyzing malware in an environment that is isolated, yet provides a virtual Internet for the malware to interact with. It runs on native hardware, therefore it is not stymied by malware which can detect VMWare and other VMs. The major stumbling block to not using VMs is the difficulty involved with repeatedly imaging machines for re-use. Truman automates this process, leaving the researcher with only minimal work to do in order to get an initial analysis of a piece of malware. Truman consists of a Linux boot image (originally based on Chas Tomlin's Windows Image Using Linux) and a collection of scripts. Also provided is pmodump, a Perl-based tool to reconstruct the virtual memory space of a process from a PhysicalMemory dump. With this tool it is possible to circumvent most packers to perform strings analysis on the dumped malware.

	* A world without malware is ideal but unlikely. Many of us would prefer *not* to install another layer of protection on their already resource constrained handheld mobile device. Alternatively, Android malware detection sans anti-virus installation has become a reality. Learn about how it’s possible to detect mobile malware using simple text messages with ZitMo NoM. ZeuS in the mobile, known as ZitMo, is infamous for intercepting SMS transmissions then redirecting them to a Command & Control in order steal banking and personal information. Research with SMS transmissions directed at mobile malware has resulted in the ability to detect ZitMo’s presence without anti,virus applications installed. Turning their own tools against them makes this even more of a rewarding endeavor. We are looking for malware researchers to contribute to the continued development of this open tool. The presentation will include the research, the infrastructure and a demonstration of ZitMo NoM. Live malware will be used during this presentation, assuming we get it to behave.

	* I will discuss how the market for exploit kits has been changing, in techniques, marketing and prices. I argue that the competitiveness between exploit kits shows a maturing market, but will leverage economic theory to demonstrate the limits to which that market will continue to mature. This should allow us to understand how exploit kits affect (and are affected by) the rest of the greater market for hacker services, from malware (as an input) to nation-state level attacks (e.g. trickle down from Hacking Team). I hope to provide a better understanding of how exploit kits work and how their sold as well as how this market can teach us about the rational choice to engage in criminal activity and how we might dissuade them.

	* FruitFly, the first OS X/macOS malware of 2017, is a rather intriguing specimen. Selectively targeting biomedical research institutions, it is thought to have flown under the radar for many years. In this talk, we'll focus on the 'B' variant of FruitFly that even now, is only detected by a handful of security products. We'll begin by analyzing the malware's dropper, an obfuscated perl script. As this language is rather archaic and uncommon in malware droppers, we'll discuss some debugging techniques and fully deconstruct the script.

An important value with IRMA comes from you keep control over where goes / who gets your data. Once you install IRMA on your network, your data stays on your network.  Each submitted files is analyzed in various ways. For now, we focus our efforts on multiple anti-virus engines, but we are working on other "probes" (feel free to submit your own).

	* This paper presents a proof of concept executable packer that does not use any custom code to unpack binaries at execution time. This is different from typical packers which generally rely on packed executables containing code that is used to perform the inverse of the packing operation at runtime. Instead of depending on custom code, the technique described in this paper uses documented behavior of the dynamic loader as a mechanism for performing the unpacking operation. This difference can make binaries packed using this technique more difficult to signature and analyze, but only when presented to an untrained eye. The description of this technique is meant to be an example of a fun thought exercise and not as some sort of revolutionary packer. In fact, it's been used in the virus world many years prior to this paper.
* [Implementing a Custom X86 Encoder](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=25&t=sumry)
	* This paper describes the process of implementing a custom encoder for the x86 architecture. To help set the stage, the McAfee Subscription Manager ActiveX control vulnerability, which was discovered by eEye, will be used as an example of a vulnerability that requires the implementation of a custom encoder. In particular, this vulnerability does not permit the use of uppercase characters. To help make things more interesting, the encoder described in this paper will also avoid all characters above 0x7f. This will make the encoder both UTF-8 safe and tolower safe. 
* [Using dual-mappings to evade automated unpackers ](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=44&t=sumry)
	* Automated unpackers such as Renovo, Saffron, and Pandora's Bochs attempt to dynamically unpack executables by detecting the execution of code from regions of virtual memory that have been written to. While this is an elegant method of detecting dynamic code execution, it is possible to evade these unpackers by dual-mapping physical pages to two distinct virtual address regions where one region is used as an editable mapping and the second region is used as an executable mapping. In this way, the editable mapping is written to during the unpacking process and the executable mapping is used to execute the unpacked code dynamically. This effectively evades automated unpackers which rely on detecting the execution of code from virtual addresses that have been written to.

Static Analysis
* Tools
	* [Pyew](https://code.google.com/p/pyew/)
		* Pyew is a (command line) python tool to analyse malware. It does have support for hexadecimal viewing, disassembly (Intel 16, 32 and 64 bits), PE and ELF file formats (it performs code analysis and let you write scripts using an API to perform many types of analysis), follows direct call/jmp instructions in the interactive command line, displays function names and string data references; supports OLE2 format, PDF format and more. It also supports plugins to add more features to the tool.
	* [Manalyze - static analyzer for PE files](https://github.com/JusticeRage/Manalyze)
		* Manalyze was written in C++ for Windows and Linux and is released under the terms of the GPLv3 license. It is a robust parser for PE files with a flexible plugin architecture which allows users to statically analyze files in-depth.

	* [Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPRqgEZXWOE)
	* [Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/)
		*  Dependency Walker is a free utility that scans any 32-bit or 64-bit Windows module (exe, dll, ocx, sys, etc.) and builds a hierarchical tree diagram of all dependent modules. For each module found, it lists all the functions that are exported by that module, and which of those functions are actually being called by other modules. Another view displays the minimum set of required files, along with detailed information about each file including a full path to the file, base address, version numbers, machine type, debug information, and more.

	* This talk catalogs the common evasion techniques malware authors employ, applying over 50 different static detections, combined with a few dynamic ones for completeness. We validate our catalog by running these detections against a database of 4 million samples (the system is constantly running and the numbers will be updated for the presentation), enabling us to present an analysis on the real state of evasion techniques in use by malware today. The resulting data will help security companies and researchers around the world to focus their attention on making their tools and processes more efficient to rapidly avoid the malware authors' countermeasures.

* [SubVirt: Implementing malware with virtual machines](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/virtual/papers/king06.pdf)
	* We evaluate a new type of malicious software that gains qualitatively more control over a system. This new type of malware, which we call a virtual-machine based rootkit (VMBR), installs a virtual-machine monitor underneath an existing operating system and hoists the original operating system into a virtual machine. Virtual-machine based rootkits are hard to detect and remove because their state cannot be accessed by soft- ware running in the target system. Further, VMBRs support general-purpose malicious services by allowing such services to run in a separate operating system that is protected from the target system. We evaluate this new threat by implementing two proof-of-concept VMBRs. We use our proof-of-concept VMBRs to subvert Windows XP and Linux target systems, and we implement four example malicious services using the VMBR platform. Last, we use what we learn from our proof-of-concept VMBRs to explore ways to defend against this new threat. We discuss possible ways to detect and prevent VMBRs, and we implement a defense strategy suitable for protecting systems against this threat.

	* In this paper we present an efficient mechanism as well as  the  corresponding  reference  implementation  for  on- the-fly infecting of executable code with malicious soft- ware. Our algorithm deploys virus infection routines and network redirection attacks, without requiring to modify the application itself. This allows to even infect executa- bles with a embedded signature when the signature is not automatically verified before execution.  We briefly dis- cuss also countermeasures such as secure channels, code authentication  as  well  as  trusted  virtualization  that  en- ables the isolation of untrusted downloads from other ap- plication running in trusted domains or compartments.

* [Malware Guard Extension: Using SGX to Conceal Cache Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08719)
	* In this paper, we demonstrate fine-grained software-based side-channel attacks from a malicious SGX enclave targeting co-located enclaves. Our attack is the first malware running on real SGX hardware, abusing SGX protection features to conceal itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack both in a native environment and across multiple Docker containers. We perform a Prime+Probe cache side-channel attack on a co-located SGX enclave running an up-to-date RSA implementation that uses a constant-time multiplication primitive. The attack works although in SGX enclaves there are no timers, no large pages, no physical addresses, and no shared memory. In a semi-synchronous attack, we extract 96% of an RSA private key from a single trace. We extract the full RSA private key in an automated attack from 11 traces within 5 minutes.
