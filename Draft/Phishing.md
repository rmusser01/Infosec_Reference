		* Business Email Compromise (aka CEO fraud) is a rapidly expanding cybercrime in which reported cases jumped 1300% from 2015 to 2016. This financial fraud scheme can target any market segment or organization regardless of size. Thousands of organizations from more than 100 countries have reported losses. The reasons for this surge is simple - it makes money.

			* In this blog post, I will go over how to use Azure Information Protection (AIP) to improve phishing campaigns from the perspective of an attacker. The idea came during an engagement where I was having trouble getting phishing emails into usersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ inboxes without being caught by a sandbox on the way. During this engagement, it struck me like a bolt of lightning that I could use AIP (also known as Rights Management Service) to protect the attachments and even the email so that only the designated recipient could open it. That way, it would not matter if the sandbox got the file since it will not be possible for it to read the contents.

			* As tried-and-true methods of code execution via phishing are getting phased out, new research was required to maintain that avenue of gaining initial access. Sifting through different file types and how they operate led to further examination of the ".Appref-ms" extension, utilized by Microsoft's ClickOnce. This research led down a long and winding road, not only resulting in some new updates to be applied to our phishing methodology but an innovative method for C2 management as well - all while staying within the means of how appref-ms is intended to be used. Follow us down the rabbit hole as we delve into what an .appref-ms file is, how it operates, and some of the methods discovered that can be leveraged to deploy our own nefarious purposes. We will also provide insight on what this execution looks like from the user's perspective, and additional steps that can be taken throughout deployment to further mask and enhance these malicious capabilities. To play our own devil's advocate, we will also cover potential indicators of compromise that result from appref-ms abuse in addition to some preemptive measures that can be deployed to protect against it. Appref-ms abuse has the potential to be a great addition to any security tester's toolkit. It runs natively on Windows 10 and 7, blends in with normal operations, and is an easily adaptable method of code delivery and execution. It's up to you to determine how to use it.

			* Abstract: OpenDocument and Open XML are both new open file formats for office documents. OpenDocument is anISO standard, promoted by OpenOffice.org and Sun StarOffice.Open XML is the new format for Microsoft Office 2007 documents, an ECMA standard. These two formats share the same basic principles: XML files within a ZIP archive, with an open schema, in contrast to good-old proprietary formats (MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, ...). However, both of them sufferfrom many security issues, similar to previous Office formats: malicious people can still embed and hide malware (Trojanhorses and viruses) thanks to macros, scripts, OLE objects and similar features. This paper shows the security issues with technical details, including XML and ZIP obfuscation techniques that may be used to bypass antiviruses, and describes howto design a filter to get rid of unwanted parts in a safe way

		* **Tools**
			* [Excel-DNA](https://excel-dna.net/)
				* Excel-DNA is an independent project to integrate .NET into Excel. With Excel-DNA you can make native (.xll) add-ins for Excel using C#, Visual Basic.NET or F#, providing high-performance user-defined functions (UDFs), custom ribbon interfaces and more. Your entire add-in can be packed into a single .xll file requiring no installation or registration.

			* [WordSteal](https://github.com/0x09AL/WordSteal)
				* This script will create a POC that will steal NTML hashes from a remote computer. Do not use this for illegal purposes.The author does not keep responsibility for any illegal action you do. Microsoft Word has the ability to include images from remote locations.This is an undocumented feature but was found used by malware creators to include images through http for statistics.We can also include remote files to a SMB server and the victim will authenticate with his logins credentials.

Originally the InkPicture.Painted() event handler was used by cyber criminals to evade antivirus prevention of the more common Document_Open() and Workbook_Open() event handlers associated with Microsoft Word and Excel. Weâ€™ve repurposed it for demonstration and went further to identify an additional InkPicture event handler that could be used as an alternative: InkPicture.Painting()."
		* [Part 2](https://whiteoaksecurity.com/blog/2020/3/17/alternative-execution-a-macro-saga-part-2)
			* "In this blog we covered abuse of the Windows Media Player ActiveX control to trigger macro execution at the point in which a maldoc is opened. We identified and implemented reference code for three event handlers that can be used without specifying a valid media file for Windows Media Player to load. These methods of executing malicious VBA code do not depend on the Document_Open() or Workbook_Open() event handlers that are more commonly utilized by malicious actors to obtain code execution."
		* [Part 3](https://whiteoaksecurity.com/blog/2020/3/26/alternative-execution-a-macro-saga-part-3)
			* "In this blog we spent the time and energy to craft another maldoc making use of an unconventional automatic execution method: The System Monitor ActiveX control. We also worked through the process I had used initially with both Windows Media Player and System Monitor by making use of the oleviewdotnet tool to enumerate and research the COM classes associated with these controls. Again, weâ€™ve been able to demonstrate executing VBA code that doesnâ€™t depend on Document_Open() or Workbook_Open() event handlers that are common with maldocs to obtain automatic execution on target systems."

				* There are powerful malicious document generation techniques that are effective at bypassing anti-virus detection. A technique which we refer to as VBA stomping refers to destroying the VBA source code in a Microsoft Office document, leaving only a compiled version of the macro code known as p-code in the document file. Maldoc detection based only on the VBA source code fails in this scenario. Reverse engineering these documents presents significant challenges as well. In this talk we will demonstrate detailed examples of VBA stomping as well as introduce some additional techniques. Reverse engineering and defense tips will also be provided.

			* The MS Office Protected-View is unlike any other sandboxes; it aims to provide only a text-view of the document contents and therefore does not have to provide full functionalities of the application. As a result, the broker -sandbox Inter-Process Communication (IPC) attack surface is greatly reduced. However this does not mean there are no vulnerabilities. This talk discussed the methodology for fuzzing this IPC attack surface, from the test-case generation to the discovery and analysis of CVE-2017-8502 and CVE-2017-8692.
