[Using the docker command to root the host (totally not a security issue)](http://reventlov.com/advisories/using-the-docker-command-to-root-the-host)

[Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester)
* Linux Exploit Suggester; based on operating system release number.  This program run without arguments will perform a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux Operating Systems release version, and return a suggestive list of possible exploits. Nothing fancy, so a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script.  Additionally possible to provide '-k' flag to manually enter the Kernel Version/Operating System Release Version.

[Basic Linux Privilege Escalation - g0tmi1k](http://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/)
* Not so much a script as a resource, g0tmi1k’s blog post here has led to so many privilege escalations on Linux system’s it’s not funny. Would definitely recommend trying out everything on this post for enumerating systems.
[LinEnum](http://www.rebootuser.com/?p=1758)
* This tool is great at running through a heap of things you should check on a Linux system in the post exploit process. This include file permissions, cron jobs if visible, weak credentials etc. The first thing I run on a newly compromised system.
[LinuxPrivChecker](http://www.securitysift.com/download/linuxprivchecker.py)
* This is a great tool for once again checking a lot of standard things like file permissions etc. The real gem of this script is the recommended privilege escalation exploits given at the conclusion of the script. This is a great starting point for escalation.
[Unix Privilege Escalation Checker](https://code.google.com/p/unix-privesc-check/)
* Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems (tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2). It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases). It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because it can read more files).

[Analyzing local privilege escalations in win32k](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=45&t=sumry)
* This paper analyzes three vulnerabilities that were found in win32k.sys that allow kernel-mode code execution. The win32k.sys driver is a major component of the GUI subsystem in the Windows operating system. These vulnerabilities have been reported by the author and patched in MS08-025. The first vulnerability is a kernel pool overflow with an old communication mechanism called the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. The second vulnerability involves improper use of the ProbeForWrite function within string management functions. The third vulnerability concerns how win32k handles system menu functions. Their discovery and exploitation are covered.

This gives you the raw data for local accounts and/or passwords enforced using Group Policy Preferences.  Microsoft chose to use a static AES key for encrypting this password.  How awesome is that!

* Windows APIs are often a blackbox with poor documentation, taking input and spewing output with little visibility on what actually happens in the background. By reverse engineering (and abusing) some of these seemingly benign APIs, we can effectively manipulate Windows into performing stealthy custom attacks using previously unknown persistent and injection techniques. In this talk, we’ll get Windows to play with itself nonstop while revealing 0day persistence, previously unknown DLL injection techniques, and Windows API tips and tricks. To top it all off, a custom HTTP beaconing backdoor will be released leveraging the newly released persistence and injection techniques. So much Windows abuse, so little time.

* Got root on OSX? Do you want to persist between reboots and have access whenever you need it? You do not need plists, new binaries, scripts, or other easily noticeable techniques. Kext programming and kernel patching can be troublesome! Leverage already running daemon processes to guarantee your access.  As the presentation will show, if given userland administrative access (read: root), how easy it is to persist between reboots without plists, non-native binaries, scripting, and kexts or kernel patching using the Backdoor Factory.
