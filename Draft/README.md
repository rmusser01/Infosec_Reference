An Information Security Reference That Doesn't Suck!
</h4>
<br>



## Goal:
- The goal of this project is to act as a free resource for anyone interested in learning more about Information Security.
	-	A list of techinques, tools and tactics to learn from or reference.
	- Rich resource of infosec knowledge for anyone to browse through as a jumping off point for various niches OR as a reference/recall method for stuff. 
	- Something like a "Yellow Pages" in the sense of you know something exists, but what was it called....
  		* 'If you give a man a fish, he is hungry again in an hour. If you teach him to catch a fish, you do him a good turn.'
	- To be clear, these aren't personal notes. I keep this repo maintained as a way of having pointers to information that I feel might help build someone's skillset or increase their understanding of attacks/methods/defenses.
- This project is not meant to condone illegal or malicious activities.
- For a HTML version of this reference, check out: [https://rmusser.net/docs](https://rmusser.net/docs)(I'm not a webdev. Can you tell?).
- For latest content updates, check the git history.
- Want to contribute a link? 
	* Anything relevant that isn't already in or covered would be/is appreciated.
