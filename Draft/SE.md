			* The purpose of this talk is to describe methodologies which one could follow when performing telephone pretexting. Social dynamics have changed over the years causing the entry barrier to being successful with Vishing more difficult and talking on the telephone less comfortable. The aim of this speech will be to crack the code for a newb getting started so he or she can hit the ground running, jump on the horn, and start pwning some folks like it's 1989.

	* While several Social Engineering talks and books focus on the techniques no one clearly explains why they work. Learn why the techniques are used and what impact they have on behavior. Discover aspects of human social interaction that can be leveraged to accomplish discrete and specific goals. Gain a firm understanding of the limitations of humans objective reasoning. Finally understand the social rules that are used to navigate within the social engineering construct.

	* This is not a presentation where I talk about how I would get in or the things I might be able to do. This is a talk where I am already in and I show you pictures from actual engagements that I have been on. They say one picture is worth a thousand words I show you how one picture cost a company a million dollars and maybe even a few lives. In a community where we focus so much on the offensive I also make sure with every attack I highlight. I spend time discussing what would have stopped me. We need to know the problems but we need more talks providing solutions and that is what I hope people will get from this. I show the dangers of Social engineering and how even an employee with no SE experience can be an eBay James Bond which can cause total financial ruin to a company. These Security threats are real. So are these stories!

	* It seems that every day there's a new NextGen firewall, whitelisting and blacklisting, DLP, or the latest technology thats suppose to stop us. But does it really stop "hackers"? Truth is, naw not really. In this talk we'll be showing off the latest bypass techniques for the "latest" hacker stoppers, using a universally whitelisted website as our middle man for a command and control, social engineering our way into some of the toughest companies, and showing off some techniques that work for us. This talk is about throwing misconceptions of protection and safety out the window, and going back the dirty south. Where thinking outside of the box is a requirement. We'll be releasing two new tools, one that makes meterpreter invisible over the network, and the other a shell that uses a popular third party as the command and control. A vulnerability scanner won't help you herrrrrrre.

	* Social engineering is hitting the headlines more than ever. As computer security becomes more sophisticated, hackers are combining their technical expertise with social engineering to gain access to IT infrastructures and critical information. In any security programme people are the weakest link. It can often be easier and quicker to target the end user than using technical hacking techniques. When you combine both social engineering and traditional hacking techniques, you have an extremely dangerous attack. So what's next on the social engineering agenda? What are the emerging trends and what social engineering techniques might we expect to see in the future? In this talk, I will give an overview of the types of social engineering attacks people have used throughout the ages, from tricks used by the classic conmen of the past to the phishing attacks that are at an all time high, and the proliferation of social networking and how useful this is to social engineers. I will describe some of the new social engineering techniques and trends that are emerging and discuss war stories from my experience of social engineering, describing techniques I have used to gain access to sensitive information

	* You are a hacker, you learn, you play, and you break. The very nature of a hacker is to question what is given to us and to play with the rules. However, most of us do not apply this methodology in all parts of our lives. Many take what is given to us about mood and health as fact and what are the results...overweight, depression, anxiety, and self esteem issues. In this presentation, we will show 2 hackers and their journey on how they addressed the issues mentioned above. Len and Moey followed two separate paths to losing over a combined 150 lbs, gaining confidence, and changing their outlook. The talk will not only cover the touchy feely portion of how to deal with weight, mood,and self esteem but will also be supported by the science behind diets, supplements and perspective. The talk will provide what worked for two hackers. YMMV. 
* [Cheat Codez: Level UP Your SE Game - Eric Smith (@InfoSecMafia)](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon3/1206-cheat-codez-level-up-your-se-game-eric-smith)
	* Everyone knows what phishing is. Everyone realizes Java applets lead to massive storms of shells. Everyone accepts tailgating is the easiest way into your building. Everyone knows smoking (areas) are bad for you AND your business. Admit it, you paid for that EXACT assessment last year. I could write your report for you without even doing the job. So what’s the problem you ask? That’s EXACTLY the problem, I say. So how do we fix these issues that plague our industry and misalign business expectations? This talk will discuss the value of Social Engineering exercises when conducted with realistic goals yielding actionable results. Of course, that means putting in REAL work throughout the engagement, not “point, click, report, rinse and repeat”. We’ll discuss tips, techniques and secrets that the PROS don’t always blog about. *PRO TIP* – This won’t be a talk on how to use a particular framework or release of a tool (there are plenty of those already). So bring your work boots, it’s time to get dirty and UP your game.
* ["Humans, right?" Soft Skills in Security - Ariel Robinson](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnova2017/200-humans-right-soft-skills-in-security-ariel-robinson)
	* Let's face it: humans ruin everything. They are almost always the weak link in the information security chain, between their susceptibility to social engineering, rejection of security threats, and sheer laziness. You can make the best security tool in the business, but if a human doesn't use it right, well, you might as well leave your passwords on a sticky note on your-- wait a minute. Yes, humans suck at information security. But we don't make it easy. Infosec is incredibly inaccessible to your average user. Just ask me: I am one. We can't change humans (or get rid of them, no matter how much we might want to), but we can change information security. We can leverage insights from non-technical disciplines such as cognitive science, human-centered design, strategic communications, and psychology. Or we can keep hitting our heads against our desktops. As a professional communicator and bridge builder, help me help you. To make security work, we have to make it easy. For humans.

		* We're smart. We're incredibly tech savvy. We can rock some mad OSINT with our Google-Fu. We're 85% +-10% sure which part of the body a hat goes on. We think you can never have enough beard. WE THINK THAT'S ACCEPTABLE. The second in his multi-part series on building social prowess, this talk will focus on the inconvenient truth of your book always, always, always being judged by its cover, and how to deal with that with minimal effort so you can get back to sewing more pockets on your utilikilt. This talk covers both male and female situations, though it is primarily unisex. We'll get you set up with a core wardrobe and hygenic skillset so you'll be able to roll out of bed, spend minimal time "getting ready," rock the dreaded client-facing meeting or industry meetup, and get you back home where you can safely take your pants off.

* **Research Papers**
	* [Construal-Level Theory of Psychological Distance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3152826/)
		* Abstract: People are capable of thinking about the future, the past, remote locations, another person’s perspective, and counterfactual alternatives. Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point—in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality—constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c) that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action.
